MASSIVE DATA SCALING STRATEGY
=============================

CURRENT STATUS
--------------
91 articles scraped (927KB)
543 fashion rules extracted
9.81 fashion density (mentions/100 words)
Deep analysis complete (1.1MB)
Total: ~2MB data

---------------------------------------
Extracted rule types:
- always/must rules
- never/avoid rules
- how_to guides
- when_to advice
- pair_with combinations
- color_match rules
- fit guidelines

URL DISCOVERY TOOLS CREATED
----------------------------
1. tools/massive_discovery.py
   - 174 search queries
   - 42 fashion sites targeted
   - Focus: "dos and donts", "rules", "style mistakes"
   - Query types: rule_search, site_rules, site_howto, site_fit, topic_rules

2. tools/discover_urls.py
   - 12 topic categories
   - 25 fashion sites
   - URL pattern matching
   - Scoring algorithm (0-100)

CHALLENGE: URL DISCOVERY
-------------------------
Cannot guess URLs - most fail with 404/403 errors.
Need REAL URLs from:
- Google/Bing search API (execute 174 queries)
- Site sitemaps (XML parsing)
- Web crawling (follow links from known pages)
- Reddit/forum scraping (r/malefashionadvice)

TO REACH GB-SCALE (500x current size)
--------------------------------------
Need ~45,000 articles (vs current 91)

Options:
1. SEARCH API integration
   - Execute massive_discovery.py queries via search API
   - Extract top 20 URLs per query = 3,480 URLs
   - Repeat with variations = 10,000+ URLs

2. SITEMAP crawling
   - Parse XML sitemaps from 42 fashion sites
   - Filter for rule/guide content
   - Automated discovery

3. WEB CRAWLING
   - Start from known good URLs
   - Follow internal links
   - Depth-first search
   - Respect robots.txt

4. REDDIT data
   - Scrape r/malefashionadvice links
   - Extract cited URLs
   - Community-validated content

NEXT STEPS
----------
User must choose approach:
- Integrate search API?
- Build sitemap parser?
- Create web crawler?
- Use existing URL database?

DETERMINISTIC & REPLICABLE: YES
- Fixed retry logic (3 attempts)
- Consistent delays (1-2s)
- JSON storage with timestamps
- Deep analysis reproduces same results
