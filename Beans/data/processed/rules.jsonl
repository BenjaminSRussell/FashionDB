A generation ago, the average office uniform was simple: a dark suit worn with a white shirt, dark tie, and pair of leather dress shoes. If you were in London, those shoes were black; if you were in the US or Continental Europe, they may have been brown. Self-expression those days was limited to the pattern on your tie. Today, things are different. Ostensibly, men can wear whatever they want to work thanks to decades of “casual Fridays.” At the same time, just because HR departments no longer regulate what we wear, that doesn’t mean most of us don’t feelsocial pressure to dress according to softly coded norms. In most offices, that means polos with khaki chinos, or perhaps t-shirts with jeans. Not as interesting as casualwear could be; not as sharp as the traditional coat-and-tie. It’s just vanilla bland. So, if you care about how you dress, you probably find yourself in a bind. What do you wear if your office doesn’t do suits, but you also don’t like the typical business casual uniform? There’s no easy answer, partly because there’s no such thing generic office (and thus, no generic worker). Dressing well requires a bit of situational awareness, and everyone has different needs. So, I thought I’d lay out eight suggestions for how to do business casual – moving from the most formal to the least. The idea is how you can dress a little sharper and feel good about yourself, without breaking out a three-piece. Hopefully there’s something in here that works for you. THE TRADITIONAL COAT-AND-TIE LOOK Most offices today don’t require suits, but a good number will allow sport coats with ties. If you’ve been reading this blog for a while, you’re probably familiar with the basics. Certain details will make a jacket look more casual, even to people who aren’t necessarily acquainted with these things. Think: a softer shoulder line, patterned fabric, or patch pockets.See our guide on how to read formality in tailored clothing. Navy sport coats here will be your workhorses. They have a professional sensibility, recalling the days with the color signified something about “city dress.”Gray jackets can also work, but they’reless versatile than those in brown. That’s because most of your trousers should be light- to mid-shades of gray, making it hard to pair the two.(Don’t try to build a trouser wardrobe without gray pants; it’s a bad idea). Charcoal trousers can also be goodif you have light-colored jackets, but they’re otherwise hard to wear (same goes for navy, which will look a little more modern than dark gray). On the other hand, tan is very useful, particularly in cotton or wool. For shirts, stick to a foundation of whites and light blues. Stripes and checks can be OK,so long as they’re simple. Remember these will serve as the background for your tie, and the more complicated the shirt, the more likely you’ll walk out the door with a clashing combination. Ties are often best in dark colors, such as navy, chocolate brown, and burgundy. I particularly like grenadines and simple rep stripes.The second is an all-American look; the first allows you to add visual interest to solid-colored jackets, but also not clash with anything patterned. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,consider picking up a few pairs of dark brown derbies. Too many men go for tan as their second pair of shoes, butthey’re considerably harder to wear. Dark brown, on the other hand, goes with everything, and derbies play better with sport coats given their slightly more informal nature (as compared to oxfords). I particularly like Norwegian split toes, but you can also choose wingtips, cap toes, or plain toes. (photos above viaMen in this TownandVoxsartoria) SPORT COATS WITHOUT A TIE If you, like me, work in a more casual office, you may be wondering how you can wear a sport coat without seeming too stiff. The answer is easy: ditch the tie. An open collar conveys a certain kind of ease that even the most casual tie won’t. Once you lose the tie, all sorts of shirt options become available. It’s easier to wear busier shirts, such as wider butcher stripes, or even dark colors (although, please never wear black dress shirts unless you’re DJ-ing a high-school prom). For something even more casual, consider dressier chambrays or long-sleeved polos. I particularly like thiswashed denim shirt I bought last year from Proper Cloth, an advertiser on this site. It’s sold out at the moment, but they bring it back every now and again. Same with the section above, you’ll want to review ourguide on how to read formality in tailored clothing. And if you’re going to work without a tie, sport coats in the most casual materials will probably be fine as well. Also worth noting: while it’s perfectly acceptable to wear a sport coat without a tie,you should never wear a tie without a tailored jacket. That is, unless you work in a cell phone store.

A generation ago, the average office uniform was simple: a dark suit worn with a white shirt, dark tie, and pair of leather dress shoes. If you were in London, those shoes were black; if you were in the US or Continental Europe, they may have been brown. Self-expression those days was limited to the pattern on your tie. Today, things are different. Ostensibly, men can wear whatever they want to work thanks to decades of “casual Fridays.” At the same time, just because HR departments no longer regulate what we wear, that doesn’t mean most of us don’t feelsocial pressure to dress according to softly coded norms. In most offices, that means polos with khaki chinos, or perhaps t-shirts with jeans. Not as interesting as casualwear could be; not as sharp as the traditional coat-and-tie. It’s just vanilla bland. So, if you care about how you dress, you probably find yourself in a bind. What do you wear if your office doesn’t do suits, but you also don’t like the typical business casual uniform? There’s no easy answer, partly because there’s no such thing generic office (and thus, no generic worker). Dressing well requires a bit of situational awareness, and everyone has different needs. So, I thought I’d lay out eight suggestions for how to do business casual – moving from the most formal to the least. The idea is how you can dress a little sharper and feel good about yourself, without breaking out a three-piece. Hopefully there’s something in here that works for you. THE TRADITIONAL COAT-AND-TIE LOOK Most offices today don’t require suits, but a good number will allow sport coats with ties. If you’ve been reading this blog for a while, you’re probably familiar with the basics. Certain details will make a jacket look more casual, even to people who aren’t necessarily acquainted with these things. Think: a softer shoulder line, patterned fabric, or patch pockets.See our guide on how to read formality in tailored clothing. Navy sport coats here will be your workhorses. They have a professional sensibility, recalling the days with the color signified something about “city dress.”Gray jackets can also work, but they’reless versatile than those in brown. That’s because most of your trousers should be light- to mid-shades of gray, making it hard to pair the two.(Don’t try to build a trouser wardrobe without gray pants; it’s a bad idea). Charcoal trousers can also be goodif you have light-colored jackets, but they’re otherwise hard to wear (same goes for navy, which will look a little more modern than dark gray). On the other hand, tan is very useful, particularly in cotton or wool. For shirts, stick to a foundation of whites and light blues. Stripes and checks can be OK,so long as they’re simple. Remember these will serve as the background for your tie, and the more complicated the shirt, the more likely you’ll walk out the door with a clashing combination. Ties are often best in dark colors, such as navy, chocolate brown, and burgundy. I particularly like grenadines and simple rep stripes.The second is an all-American look; the first allows you to add visual interest to solid-colored jackets, but also not clash with anything patterned. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,consider picking up a few pairs of dark brown derbies. Too many men go for tan as their second pair of shoes, butthey’re considerably harder to wear. Dark brown, on the other hand, goes with everything, and derbies play better with sport coats given their slightly more informal nature (as compared to oxfords). I particularly like Norwegian split toes, but you can also choose wingtips, cap toes, or plain toes. (photos above viaMen in this TownandVoxsartoria) SPORT COATS WITHOUT A TIE If you, like me, work in a more casual office, you may be wondering how you can wear a sport coat without seeming too stiff. The answer is easy: ditch the tie. An open collar conveys a certain kind of ease that even the most casual tie won’t. Once you lose the tie, all sorts of shirt options become available. It’s easier to wear busier shirts, such as wider butcher stripes, or even dark colors (although, please never wear black dress shirts unless you’re DJ-ing a high-school prom). For something even more casual, consider dressier chambrays or long-sleeved polos. I particularly like thiswashed denim shirt I bought last year from Proper Cloth, an advertiser on this site.

Assuming they’re not advertorials (which we never do), they’re often too constraining and dictatorial.Ten Things Every Man Must Own! The Correct Way to Wear This Item! In reality, as people develop their own personal sense of style,they’ll find their own essentials— things that often will never make it onto such lists or even be useful to other people. But if you’re just starting out, you may not have a very good sense of personal taste or even aesthetic direction. So, it can be useful for someone to lead you through some of the most basic purchases, even if they’re only a springboard for you to explore other areas. So, here’s our list of “menswear essentials” with some caveats. We’ve gone through and listed things we think would be a solid, starting wardrobe, as well as reasons for why we think each item is useful. Each section has a list of links for further reading. Many of the things on this list are good basics that can stay with you for years, even as you explore other areas and develop your own sense of personal style. You don’t need to own everything on this list, but at least you can go into the wardrobe building process with some suggestions. THE ONE ACTUAL ESSENTIAL The Sincere Suit:Truthfully, there’s only one real wardrobe essential. No matter your background or lifestyle, you need a sincere suit — something to wear to serious occasions. Weddings, funerals, christenings, court appearances, big meetings, or job interviews.As Jesse once put it, “even professional surfers who live in beach huts in Bali have great-uncles who die back in Fresno. And great-aunts who’d feel bad if their grand-nephew showed up to the funeral in khakis and a polo shirt.” The thing is, getting a good suit takes time. You don’t want to shop for one at the last minute, otherwise you’ll be forced to drop $500 on something that doesn’t look quite right and you don’t love. So start shopping for a sincere suit now, well before you actually need one. We recommend getting something conservatively styled, in a single-breasted configuration with notch lapels and made from a dark gray or navy wool. Something that you’ll still be happy to wear in ten or fifteen years. For people who don’t wear suits often,you can also try to find a suit that can be broken into separates. That way, the jacket can do double-duty as a sport coat when you need (although, you’ll want to make sure the wool isn’t too shiny, which will give up the game). Related posts:You Need a Sincere Suit;What Should You Get for Your First Suit?,A Japanese Guide on How a Suit Should Fit, andSuggestions for Where to Look for a Suit Parts OneandTwo So now you have your sincere suit, you need some things to go along with it. A rundown of the accouterments: White Dress Shirt:The plain white dress shirt is the foundation of a more formal suit-and-tie outfit. Something made from a smooth, plain fabric such as poplin, cut with a semi-spread collar that’s large enough to take a necktie (avoid skimpy collars). The key here is all in the fit. In one of our webisodes,you can see Carl from CEGO Custom Shirtmakers run through some of the basics of how a shirt should fit. Dark Necktie:If you only own necktie, make it a black or navy silk grenadine. The texture adds visual interest to plainer ensembles, while the solid color makes this an easy pairing with patterned jackets and shirts. If you want to expand your wardrobe later, you can get some rep stripes and subtly patterned grey ties — say, black and white glen plaids — to supplement. Discretely patterned gray ties are great for formal occasions, and they pair well with navy. White Linen Pocket Square:A pocket square is the easiest and most affordable way to improve the look of a suit or sport coat. Pick a crisp, white linen pocket square to start, which you can wear in theTV or Presidential fold. Its simplicity makes it easy to wear with almost any tailored jacket. When choosing one, get something with plump, handrolled edges (we sell some). It’s a small detail, but it helps separate the square from those with flat machine-sewn edges, which often look cheap. Dress Shoes: If you think you’ll be wearing suits often, nothing beats a pair ofblack or dark brown oxfords. They’re sl", "id": 33}

Something made from a smooth, plain fabric such as poplin, cut with a semi-spread collar that’s large enough to take a necktie (avoid skimpy collars). The key here is all in the fit. In one of our webisodes,you can see Carl from CEGO Custom Shirtmakers run through some of the basics of how a shirt should fit. Dark Necktie:If you only own necktie, make it a black or navy silk grenadine. The texture adds visual interest to plainer ensembles, while the solid color makes this an easy pairing with patterned jackets and shirts. If you want to expand your wardrobe later, you can get some rep stripes and subtly patterned grey ties — say, black and white glen plaids — to supplement. Discretely patterned gray ties are great for formal occasions, and they pair well with navy. White Linen Pocket Square:A pocket square is the easiest and most affordable way to improve the look of a suit or sport coat. Pick a crisp, white linen pocket square to start, which you can wear in theTV or Presidential fold. Its simplicity makes it easy to wear with almost any tailored jacket. When choosing one, get something with plump, handrolled edges (we sell some). It’s a small detail, but it helps separate the square from those with flat machine-sewn edges, which often look cheap.

So, here’s our list of “menswear essentials” with some caveats. We’ve gone through and listed things we think would be a solid, starting wardrobe, as well as reasons for why we think each item is useful. Each section has a list of links for further reading. Many of the things on this list are good basics that can stay with you for years, even as you explore other areas and develop your own sense of personal style. You don’t need to own everything on this list, but at least you can go into the wardrobe building process with some suggestions. THE ONE ACTUAL ESSENTIAL The Sincere Suit:Truthfully, there’s only one real wardrobe essential. No matter your background or lifestyle, you need a sincere suit — something to wear to serious occasions. Weddings, funerals, christenings, court appearances, big meetings, or job interviews.As Jesse once put it, “even professional surfers who live in beach huts in Bali have great-uncles who die back in Fresno. And great-aunts who’d feel bad if their grand-nephew showed up to the funeral in khakis and a polo shirt.” The thing is, getting a good suit takes time. You don’t want to shop for one at the last minute, otherwise you’ll be forced to drop $500 on something that doesn’t look quite right and you don’t love. So start shopping for a sincere suit now, well before you actually need one. We recommend getting something conservatively styled, in a single-breasted configuration with notch lapels and made from a dark gray or navy wool. Something that you’ll still be happy to wear in ten or fifteen years. For people who don’t wear suits often,you can also try to find a suit that can be broken into separates. That way, the jacket can do double-duty as a sport coat when you need (although, you’ll want to make sure the wool isn’t too shiny, which will give up the game).

In reality, as people develop their own personal sense of style,they’ll find their own essentials— things that often will never make it onto such lists or even be useful to other people.

So, it can be useful for someone to lead you through some of the most basic purchases, even if they’re only a springboard for you to explore other areas. So, here’s our list of “menswear essentials” with some caveats. We’ve gone through and listed things we think would be a solid, starting wardrobe, as well as reasons for why we think each item is useful. Each section has a list of links for further reading. Many of the things on this list are good basics that can stay with you for years, even as you explore other areas and develop your own sense of personal style. You don’t need to own everything on this list, but at least you can go into the wardrobe building process with some suggestions. THE ONE ACTUAL ESSENTIAL The Sincere Suit:Truthfully, there’s only one real wardrobe essential. No matter your background or lifestyle, you need a sincere suit — something to wear to serious occasions. Weddings, funerals, christenings, court appearances, big meetings, or job interviews.As Jesse once put it, “even professional surfers who live in beach huts in Bali have great-uncles who die back in Fresno. And great-aunts who’d feel bad if their grand-nephew showed up to the funeral in khakis and a polo shirt.” The thing is, getting a good suit takes time. You don’t want to shop for one at the last minute, otherwise you’ll be forced to drop $500 on something that doesn’t look quite right and you don’t love. So start shopping for a sincere suit now, well before you actually need one. We recommend getting something conservatively styled, in a single-breasted configuration with notch lapels and made from a dark gray or navy wool. Something that you’ll still be happy to wear in ten or fifteen years. For people who don’t wear suits often,you can also try to find a suit that can be broken into separates. That way, the jacket can do double-duty as a sport coat when you need (although, you’ll want to make sure the wool isn’t too shiny, which will give up the game).

A rundown of the accouterments: White Dress Shirt:The plain white dress shirt is the foundation of a more formal suit-and-tie outfit. Something made from a smooth, plain fabric such as poplin, cut with a semi-spread collar that’s large enough to take a necktie (avoid skimpy collars). The key here is all in the fit. In one of our webisodes,you can see Carl from CEGO Custom Shirtmakers run through some of the basics of how a shirt should fit. Dark Necktie:If you only own necktie, make it a black or navy silk grenadine. The texture adds visual interest to plainer ensembles, while the solid color makes this an easy pairing with patterned jackets and shirts. If you want to expand your wardrobe later, you can get some rep stripes and subtly patterned grey ties — say, black and white glen plaids — to supplement. Discretely patterned gray ties are great for formal occasions, and they pair well with navy. White Linen Pocket Square:A pocket square is the easiest and most affordable way to improve the look of a suit or sport coat. Pick a crisp, white linen pocket square to start, which you can wear in theTV or Presidential fold. Its simplicity makes it easy to wear with almost any tailored jacket. When choosing one, get something with plump, handrolled edges (we sell some). It’s a small detail, but it helps separate the square from those with flat machine-sewn edges, which often look cheap.

In reality, as people develop their own personal sense of style,they’ll find their own essentials— things that often will never make it onto such lists or even be useful to other people. But if you’re just starting out, you may not have a very good sense of personal taste or even aesthetic direction. So, it can be useful for someone to lead you through some of the most basic purchases, even if they’re only a springboard for you to explore other areas. So, here’s our list of “menswear essentials” with some caveats. We’ve gone through and listed things we think would be a solid, starting wardrobe, as well as reasons for why we think each item is useful. Each section has a list of links for further reading. Many of the things on this list are good basics that can stay with you for years, even as you explore other areas and develop your own sense of personal style. You don’t need to own everything on this list, but at least you can go into the wardrobe building process with some suggestions. THE ONE ACTUAL ESSENTIAL The Sincere Suit:Truthfully, there’s only one real wardrobe essential. No matter your background or lifestyle, you need a sincere suit — something to wear to serious occasions. Weddings, funerals, christenings, court appearances, big meetings, or job interviews.As Jesse once put it, “even professional surfers who live in beach huts in Bali have great-uncles who die back in Fresno. And great-aunts who’d feel bad if their grand-nephew showed up to the funeral in khakis and a polo shirt.” The thing is, getting a good suit takes time. You don’t want to shop for one at the last minute, otherwise you’ll be forced to drop $500 on something that doesn’t look quite right and you don’t love. So start shopping for a sincere suit now, well before you actually need one. We recommend getting something conservatively styled, in a single-breasted configuration with notch lapels and made from a dark gray or navy wool. Something that you’ll still be happy to wear in ten or fifteen years. For people who don’t wear suits often,you can also try to find a suit that can be broken into separates. That way, the jacket can do double-duty as a sport coat when you need (although, you’ll want to make sure the wool isn’t too shiny, which will give up the game). Related posts:You Need a Sincere Suit;What Should You Get for Your First Suit?,A Japanese Guide on How a Suit Should Fit, andSuggestions for Where to Look for a Suit Parts OneandTwo So now you have your sincere suit, you need some things to go along with it. A rundown of the accouterments: White Dress Shirt:The plain white dress shirt is the foundation of a more formal suit-and-tie outfit. Something made from a smooth, plain fabric such as poplin, cut with a semi-spread collar that’s large enough to take a necktie (avoid skimpy collars). The key here is all in the fit. In one of our webisodes,you can see Carl from CEGO Custom Shirtmakers run through some of the basics of how a shirt should fit. Dark Necktie:If you only own necktie, make it a black or navy silk grenadine. The texture adds visual interest to plainer ensembles, while the solid color makes this an easy pairing with patterned jackets and shirts. If you want to expand your wardrobe later, you can get some rep stripes and subtly patterned grey ties — say, black and white glen plaids — to supplement. Discretely patterned gray ties are great for formal occasions, and they pair well with navy. White Linen Pocket Square:A pocket square is the easiest and most affordable way to improve the look of a suit or sport coat. Pick a crisp, white linen pocket square to start, which you can wear in theTV or Presidential fold. Its simplicity makes it easy to wear with almost any tailored jacket. When choosing one, get something with plump, handrolled edges (we sell some). It’s a small detail, but it helps separate the square from those with flat machine-sewn edges, which often look cheap.

The reason is simple. Gray as a color visually fades into the background, allowing the focus to be on your shirt, tie, and jacket combination (which is where you want it). Light and mid-gray will be your most versatile shades; charcoal less so because it often doesn’t lend enough contrast to darker colored jackets. Get a pair in flannel wool, then some subtle weaves such as whipcord and pick-and-pick. If you’re looking to expand your trouser wardrobe later, start with tan.

I thought about sending him to the various guides Jesse and I havewritten on the topic, but realized they might be too much to read for someone who doesn’t have a particular interest in menswear. So I wrote out a very basic checklist – something simple, practical, and easy-to-use for how to evaluate if a suit jacket or sport coat fits, with links to longer articles in case anyone wants to read more. The guiding principle for how a suit jacket should fit is pretty simple. There should be clean lines all around, with no puckering or pulling anywhere, and the jacket should flatter the body (this doesn’t mean it should be super tight). Looking at photos of our friendsVoxsartoriaandMostExerentcan be instructive. After that, there are some other details you might want to pay attention to: The second section above is admittedly a bit nit-picky, but it points to some good things to pay attention to when evaluating how a jacket looks on you. Fortunately, there are some workarounds if you see something you don’t like. If the cut of the quarters doesn’t look good, or if the buttoning point is too high, you can always just wear the jacket unbuttoned. And if the balance is a bit off, you can ask an alterations tailor to move the buttons up a bit so that they align with the buttonholes. Finding the perfect jacket can be difficult, so how much you care about getting the perfect fit will greatly depend on how much time and money you want to spend. But at least now you know what to look for. Filed Under:Best Of,Fit,Guides", "id": 77}
