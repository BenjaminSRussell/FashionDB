      "body": "Natalino: Cheaper well-styled tailoringWednesday, October 16th2024Tags:JacketsSuitsnatalinoShareShare this postSubscribe138 Comments||- Begin Content -||Natalinooffers a lower level of tailoring than most brands we cover, but with much more PS style than others at that price point. Particularly now they have a physical shop in London, they\u2019re competing with the likes of Hackett, Boggi or SuitSupply, and I\u2019d certainly recommend Natalino over them.For quite a long time, I confess, I didn\u2019t pay much attention to Natalino. The selling point seemed to be mostly price; they were cheaper than anyone else selling Neapolitan-style tailoring and there didn't seem to be much added in terms of style.When we went into the store recently and spoke to the founder Nathan, he talking about this point around price: he started Natalino online after leaving his job at Merrill Lynch, because while he and his friends loved having bespoke Neapolitan tailoring, they didn\u2019t want to pay that as day-to-day clothing. Price was always a factor.There are a few problems with selling on price, but one is it restricts how much you can add your own personality - basically, how much you can sell the clothes you want. \u201cThe Neapolitan factories we worked with all had a default style that was shorter, tighter, with big dramatic lapels,\u201d said Nathan. Developing a separate block and style takes time, and money.\u201cThis double-breasted you\u2019re trying on,\u201d he said as I tried a size-48 navy flannel in the store, \u201cis our fifth variation of the style. It\u2019s now much more what we like than at the beginning. It\u2019s more relaxed, with a lower and more rounded peak. It\u2019s easier to wear more casually.\u201dSince Nathan brought on staff David and Ruben last year, and opened the shop on Mortimer Street, the company has changed a fair bit. \u201cWe now do more of our own photography, lookbooks, we communicate the style,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re also getting better at having stock in - though as things have been so busy since we opened, even that\u2019s been hard to keep on top of.\u201dThe shop and staff mean added costs, but Nathan has done his best to keep price increases down. \u201cThey have gone up, but not much. We still have a lot of guys coming in because the value point so we need to retain that.\u201d A jacket is now between \u00a3450 and \u00a3525, with trousers \u00a3195 extra.Of course, the price would be meaningless if the style wasn\u2019t also good, and I was impressed at what I tried on.The jackets are all made in Naples (the trousers in Portugal) and it has that feeling of a genuine Neapolitan jacket:spalla camiciashoulder, open foreparts, rounded and rolling front edge. It has all the aspects of Neapolitan style that have made it so popular, with none of the extreme details.The armhole is quite high and the sleeve large, which is also impressive at this price. The block itself works particularly well on those with more sloping shoulders, Nathan admits, and so it\u2019s good on me. Those with really square shoulders find it harder.And it should be made clear that Natalino don\u2019t do MTM or anything similar - only ready-to-wear and alterations to it.If I was being picky I\u2019d want a little less pick stitching on the edges and lapels, but I know some readers will like that. The trousers are also genuinely high rise, which is not what I prefer, but again some will love it. Things like the shetland knits they now do are cut shorter with those trousers in mind.So if the cut is good, what do you lose by being at this price level rather than Anglo-Italian, for example?Well the differences are actually quite clear when you put the jacket on. The fronts are partly fused and the lapels and collar feel solid. There is none of the malleability you get with a more hand-made garment, or the three-dimensional elements you get with something like a curved, hand-attached collar. The jackets are also only half-canvassed.There are other online sellers where you can perhaps get a higher quality level for a similar price, but comparing Natalino to its peers in London, this still feels like good value - Anglo-Italian is certainly better made, but a jacket there now starts at \u00a31,100.And as I said earlier, the style compares very well with the likes of Hackett, Boggi or Suit Supply (though the latter is cheaper). The biggest thing Natalino probably lacks compared to those is variety - other than one tobacco linen, the range is entirely grey and navy at the moment.\u201cThis is something we will slowly look to expand on,\u201d says Nathan. \u201cTo be honest, most people want navy and grey, in fact the biggest request we get is for more standard suits, in worsteds rather than flannel, but it is good to do some interesting patterns and colours.\u201d Variety, of course, is one more thing that comes with a cost.I haven\u2019t yet tried the rest of the clothes at Natalino, but the shirts look like a good proposition: simple make but with nice style, like the tailoring.The knitwear will be too short for me, while the jeans are an impressively high rise but I\u2019m not so keen on the washes. They have done other categories in the past, including rip-stop cargo trousers made in Japan, and are developing T-shirts and shorts.It\u2019s an interesting operation, with a contemporary-feeling store, stylish staff and now more developed product. I\u2019m happy to say I was wrong to discount Nathan and what he was doing for so long; hopefully this piece will go some way to correct that.natalino.co46 Mortimer St, London W1W 7RLRelated postsFive good ready-made suits under \u00a31000August 16th2023 - 167 CommentsRead MoreThe (17) made-to-measure tailors I have knownJuly 12th2021 - 222 CommentsRead MoreBuilding a wardrobe: Neapolitan tailoringJanuary 6th2017 - 232 CommentsRead MoreSubscribeNotify ofNew commentsNew replies to my commentsLabelName*EmailWebsite\u0394LabelName*EmailWebsite\u0394138CommentsOldestNewestInline FeedbacksView all commentsLoad more comments",

I've noticed this in the past, particularly when going out, but it struck home strongly during our launch party for the second issue of the magazine last week.The party itself was crazy. Held over the two floors of the newBuck Mason store in Soho, there were over 500 people at one point. Magazines ran out, drink ran out, the in-house bar downstairs had to be raided at one point. New York really turned up.But across the room I kept on spotting interesting outfits - ones that were more dressed up, more unusual, more expressive. Something kept on catching my eye, whether it was brightly striped shetlands or an all-black outfit with a half dozen variations in tone and texture.There was formal tailoring (executed very well) but also French workwear (with a nice faded plaid). There was full-on western wear, but also western wear mixed with tailoring or sportswear. It all mixed together naturally - very little felt forced or generic.I loved it, and fortunately the Buck guys took loads of photos. So here are some of our favourite outfits from the evening. Apologies that we didn't know everyone to tag and thank them by name.Thank you to everyone who came to the pop-up also, which was the busiest we've ever had. And of course to the J Mueser team for hosting us.At the event, many thanks to Lagavulin for the wonderful cocktails, and toChris John Millingtonfor the photos.The magazine is available from ushere, and from lots of menswear stockists around the world, listed onthis article. Do buy from your local supplier if you can - it's cheaper and uses less fuel!Related postsWhy a bespoke suit is like a haircutNovember 5th2025 - 0 CommentsRead MoreRalph Lauren cap: How great things ageNovember 3rd2025 - 63 CommentsRead MoreThe menswear I got from my DadOctober 31st2025 - 57 CommentsRead MoreSubscribeNotify ofNew commentsNew replies to my commentsLabelName*EmailWebsite\u0394LabelName*EmailWebsite\u039447CommentsOldestNewestInline FeedbacksView all commentsLoad more comments",

      "body": "The breadth and style of Korean tailoringMonday, December 18th2023Tags:SuitsAssisib&tailorCcalimalaLericiLuca MuseoTranquil HouseShareShare this postSubscribe68 Comments||- Begin Content -||On the Wednesday night of my recent trip to Seoul, there was a party to celebrate the anniversary of the local cloth agency, Renovatio. The founder Sam Ahn invited everyone in the industry, and over 200 people turned up.I have never seen so many well-tailored men in one place. They were young (on average), they were stylish (the occasional pink-shoed peacock apart) and they were all wearing suits and ties. It was wonderful.Korea is not a big market compared to the UK or Japan - and tiny compared to the US - yet it supports a large number of tailors, from cheap MTM to bespoke. Walking around Seoul, you see more tailoring-related outlets than in probably any other city, including several alterations houses that have also expanded into making their own things.This is particularly impressive in a country where (as I noted inour Seoul shopping guide) few people wear suits. There isn't the conservative office culture of Japan, and most tailoring is worn by choice.Like Hong Kong, Seoul has always had a plethora of tailors, at a low level. It\u2019s quite standard in a less industrialised country, and South Korea was poor for a long time after the Korean War ended. Ready-to-wear fashion really only arrived strongly in the 1990s.Yet despite the subsequent growth of fashion, bespoke or at least personalised tailoring saw a big resurgence around 10 years ago. The trend for craft and heritage hit hard, and Seoul saw many new tailor shops set up, as well as greater awareness of those that already existed.B&Tailorwas part of that trend. Head tailor Jung yul Park had been running his own shop since 1967, but it was when his sons caught the bug for tailoring that the style (and popularity) of the shop was transformed. Chad in particular (above) showed he had a talent for modernising bespoke style and for communicating it online.In fact two of the other strong tailors in Seoul, Assisi and Luca Museo, have members that worked at B&Tailor at one point. It\u2019s still a small world, and inevitably one with intricate politics.The first foreign-trained tailor to set up in Seoul, however, was Jeon Byeong-ha (above), who had trained in Naples with master Antonio Pascariello (a contemporary of Noriyuki Ueki, nowSartoria Ciccioin Tokyo).Jeon arrived back in Korea in 2013, and called his atelierSartoria Napoletana- a name which might seem generic to us, but makes perfect sense to describe what it does to Korean customers.In recent years Jeon has added ready-to-wear to his offering, creating patterns for factory-made garments that are sold in his atelier and in shops such asParlour(under the label Sartoria Jun). This was largely a reaction to a difficulty finding good apprentices, which has substantially limited the amount of bespoke he can make.We visited the team and saw some of the RTW, my favourite piece of which was a quilted jacket made in navy velvet (pictured top). Designed to fit over tailoring, it was the perfect length and big enough in the shoulders to cover my tweed jacket.We also visited the new atelier ofAssisi(above), where I was having a final fitting on the light-grey summer suit (Ascot 4-ply from Drapers) we had started at Pitti.Assisi are everything that makes me excited about Korean tailoring. The standard of the work is good, the fit (which I experiencedhere) is extremely good, and they have real style. Dabin is always wearing something I\u2019d wear, which is freakishly uncommon in bespoke.It makes sense when you see their atelier, because everything there is stylish. The lighting, the sound system, the furniture. There\u2019s the kind of taste level we\u2019re more used to seeing from MTM brands such as Saman Amel or Stoffa, but married to hand craft.Same goes forLuca Museo(above). They have a lovely, warm space just off a major shopping street in the south side of Seoul. B&Tailor are nearby, though Jun and Assisi are in the north (Assisi in a very rich residential area - the BTS house is up the street).Luca started the business after many years at Sartoria Vanni, one of the most established Korean tailors. The other two team members are Chan, who started as a trouser maker at B&Tailor; and Ivano, who also started there but spent time with Sartoria Raffaniello in Japan and Pirozzi in Italy.I started the process of making a suit with Luca Museo, so we\u2019ll cover that when it\u2019s finished. They come to Pitti occasionally, including in January, and that will be the mechanism for getting it done. They\u2019re not travelling for trunk shows yet, unlike B&Tailor and Assisi.In terms of style, Jun is very Neapolitan but most others are a mix of influences, including some elements of Florentine tailoring. Assisi is quite generous in its cut, as I noted inmy review, while Luca Museo has a penchant for roped shoulders (though they're happy to soften them).The one tailor that\u2019s different in that regard is Donghyun Kim, akaTranquil House(above). Kim trained in the UK, studying at London College of Fashion and then working on Savile Row.Since returning to Korea he has proved popular as the only English-style tailor, and he\u2019s helped brands design patterns for their ready-to-wear as well. Kim has a lovely space on the second floor of a building in central Seoul, and when we were there we saw some of the ready-to-wear shirts and trousers he now offers too.Kim is particularly committed to the idea of \u2018rock of eye\u2019 tailoring, where some parts of a customer\u2019s pattern are drawn freehand. \u201cI remember how hard it was to teach that - to draw the oval shape of an armhole for instance,\u201d he told us. \u201cI used to go home, switch out the lights, and draw 200 ovals on my coffee table before I went to bed each night. Eventually I got it.\u201dOther notable tailors include Corallo Rosso, who studied at Istituto Secoli in Milan and worked as a tailor at Eduardo de Simone before returning to Korea. He\u2019s pursued more of a tailoring academy business and many of the current generation of tailors in Korea have been students.There\u2019s Hacheon, who I knew already from Sartoria Vestrucci in Florence as he had fitted me there in the past. He originally studied under Francesco Guida and only came back to Korea last year. He\u2019s currently setting up his own local tailor under the brand nameCcalimala.And finally there\u2019sLerici, which is probably the best known internationally (coveredhere in Monocle) but recently changed gear from a formal-wear shop in an affluent area of Seoul to a more artistic outfit in a secluded house in the hills.They had an exhibition in the space when we visited, which was beautiful. Seoul is surrounded by four mountains and you quickly get up into the hills when you drive out. From the Lerici garden you could look down on the old town and see the broad Han river below.The clothing we saw was mostly womenswear and non-formal tailoring, such as quilted jackets. But a couture-like atelier behind glass panels was hand-sewing tailoring, and that was mostly what was on the racks. It feels like Lerici is less likely to appeal to PS readers, but it does demonstrate the breadth of Korean tailoring today.I'll go into more detail on each tailor when they are covered in more detail in the future. I'll also detail things like prices, although in general Korean tailors are at a discount to European ones, even on trunk shows. See Assisi pricingherefor example.Related postsLuca Museo navy three-piece suit: ReviewOctober 14th2024 - 89 CommentsRead MoreAssisi double-breasted summer suit: ReviewMay 20th2024 - 161 CommentsRead MoreB&Tailor: Real bespoke, distinctive styleFebruary 5th2024 - 34 CommentsRead MoreSubscribeNotify ofNew commentsNew replies to my commentsLabelName*EmailWebsite\u0394LabelName*EmailWebsite\u039468CommentsOldestNewestInline FeedbacksView all commentsLoad more comments",

He concedes that Chicago is \u201calright\u201d and is willing to accept that San Francisco \u201cis a lovely place\u201d. But, in a rattling and light-hearted smackdown, he makes it known what all those other cities lack:\u201cIt hasn't got the hansoms in the park / It hasn't got a skyline after darkIt hasn't got the handy subway train / You seldom find a taxi when it rainsIt hasn't got the opera in The Met / It hasn't got a famous string quartet\u201dAnd that, ladies, and gentlemen, is why New York is his home, sweet home.Sammy Davis Jr. in Manhattan - Burt Glinn (1959)However, one thing Sammy doesn\u2019t list as a virtue of New York is bespoke tailoring.Now that could just be because it\u2019s very difficult to rhyme \u201cit hasn\u2019t got a well-established, diverse range of artisans making quality bespoke.\u201dOr it could be that this magnificent metropolis (and, by the way, if the medical community ever wanted definitive evidence that a person can beliterallybored to death, just watch me to talk to someone for an hour about how much I love New York City), relative to London at least, doesn\u2019t have the bespoke tailoring history, the longevity of names, or the sheer weight of numbers one might expect.Cary Grant (1957) \u2013 A customer of many of the great New York tailorsWhich, of course, isn\u2019t to say there weren\u2019t (or aren\u2019t) brilliant craftspeople forging their own identity and style in the New World. It\u2019s just their stories are afforded less prominence than those of the houses of Savile Row or thesartoriaof Naples.I\u2019d like to help address this through a series of articles that will dive into the history of New York bespoke\u2013 a continuation of a process Simon began with thiscompilation of tailorsworking in the city today, and, more recently, his bespoke review ofPaolo Martorano. In future pieces, I\u2019ll look in detail at some of the most venerated.However, to help set the scene, we could think of no better authorities thanG. Bruce BoyerandAlan Flusserwho were most generous in sharing their recollections of the scene, their take on who some of the most influential names were, and what remains today.Bruce Boyer and Alan Flusser out and about in New YorkOn the scene in its heydayAlan Flusser (AF):Like any menswear capital, while generally deferential to all things Savile Row, Manhattan was host to a lively community of European-trained bench tailors as well as those bred on the East Coast carriage trade. The sixties saw many of them retire as upstarts like myself came onto the scene.Bruce Boyer (BB):I came on the New York scene in 1973 when I started writing forTown & Countryabout men's clothing. The majority of tailors were Italian, with a few British representatives.On the options for a sartorial man about townAF:Those was the days when a typical, sartorially capable male would have started at Brooks Brothers and gotten that very, very special grounding in taste and attitude about the way clothes should look and feel.And then Paul Stuart was the next step because, in the sixties and seventies, they made shaped clothes \u2013 which women loved because it made men look sexier and thinner and younger.And then the question of where you were going to go next, depended on the personality of the person. You were either going to get something custom made or you were going to wear a Pierre Cardin suit (who I worked for in the early seventies). It wasn\u2019t as good quality as Brooks Brothers or Paul Stuart, but it had cachet, it had a look to it.Print ad for Paul Stuart (1960)On the most celebrated names of New York bespoke/customBB:At that time, and over the next half century the most significant names in individualised tailoring were William Fioravanti, Morty Sills, Piero Dimitri, Henry Stewart, Dunhill Tailors, Roland Meledandri, Leonard Logsdail, Bernard Weatherill, Alan Flusser, Vincent Nicolosi, Cheo, Mimmo Spano, Nino Corvato, and Gilberto.Of course, Spano and Flusser were not tailors, they were stylists, but Alan probably introduced more men here to personalised clothing than anyone, and Mimmo Spano started off working for Alan.Fioravanti in his Manhattan studioOn William FioravantiBB:Bill Fioravanti was the most expensive (if he were in business today, his suits would probably start at about $10,000) and most successful tailor in NYC, with the largest number of tailors on premise, around 20.His house style was similar to what Brioni in Rome was doing in that period. In the early seventies he designed what was called The Power Look, an architectural silhouette streamlined to a hard glamour with straight, high shoulders, a close waist and hipline, narrow sleeves and trousers. It was very clean. No wrinkles were permitted to mar the image of complete confidence for the successful executive businessman.AF:Very charming guy. Bill made handmade clothing, but not in the tradition of England, in the tradition of Rome. And Bill's bailiwick was that he made very fitted clothes - Italian fitted clothes \u2013 with an overall purpose to make somebody look thin. So, clothes were cut in such a way that they gave you a much leaner line to everything.Brooks Brothers suits (Spring 1955)It wasn't a place that, by Hollywood or men's fashion standards, you'd think well-dressed men go, because it butted up against traditional American notions (from Brooks Brothers) that you don't want to see a guy who's been compressed into a suit and there's no wrinkles, etc. So it was a style of clothing that kind of fought, to a degree, with traditional American architecture.But the quality of what he made was legitimate. And especially in the early days, you couldn't buy a ready-made suit that looked like that - nobody was selling it.BB:A few years ago, I was in Bill\u2019s atelier, and one of his customers came in - this guy was the president of a very large American bank. He said to me, \"Mr. Boyer, do you know why I wear Fioravanti's clothes?\" I wanted to say, \"Because God gave you too much money?\" But I didn't, I said, \"Why?\u201d And he said, \"Because when I walk into the boardroom, I want everybody to understand, even before I open my mouth, who's in charge here. And his clothes do that for me.\" There was a great truth in that, all the way around.Truman Capote in a Dunhill Tailors dinner suit (1966)On Dunhill TailorsBB:Not to be confused with the English firm of the same name \u2013 Dunhill Tailors was run by two brothers from Pennsylvania. They made a good team because one had the better eye for design and the other for business.Dunhill Tailors was popular for almost half a century with the EEE (Eastern Elite Establishment) who wanted no-nonsense tailoring of high quality and tasteful styling. The house style was mid-Atlantic, a bit of Ivy mixed with a bit of British and characterised by a middle-of-the-road philosophy of everything in moderation.Quiet yet stylish, well-made, well-fitted garments that spoke softly but carried a lot of weight.Richard Roundtree wearing Morty Sills for the film Shaft (1971)On Morty SillsAF:Morty was this very avuncular and down-to-earth man. He had the young Wall Street, Master-of-the-Universe guy. And, as a matter of fact, even though I did the clothes inWall Streetthe movie, I think Michael Douglas tells Charlie Sheen togo to Morty Sillsand get some clothes.BB:Morty became an iconic name in town among young executives who wanted something a bit more sophisticated than Ivy style. Morty once told me his ideal was Fred Astaire, and he more or less copied Astaire's look: an Ivy-styled coat but with subtle shape, small extended shoulder, soft chest and nipped waist, flared skirt with side vents, moderate lapels and sleeves that tapered at the wrist.AF:He was a Fred Astaire-philebecause he looked a little bit like Astaire, same body. He liked fitted clothes, a natural shoulder type which a lot of people were starting to experiment with. Paul Stuart had introduced a soft shoulder, two-button coat - that was a big deal. Ralph Lauren was also coming on with a soft shouldered, fitted coat.BB:It was a hybrid of Savile Row and Princeton, taking the best of both and constructing a comfortable, stylish, and slightly casual look; an elegantly balanced silhouette, nothing over- or under-wrought. He had a clientele of young lawyers, stockbrokers, entrepreneurs, and a few confident celebrities who would have shopped at Dick Carroll's if they were on the West Coast.Lee Marvin wearing Henry Stewart for the film Gorky Park (1983)On Henry StewartAF:Henry was probably the most traditional tailor out of the conventional Savile Row experience.And he had very trained Savile Row taste. That means that he understood, as an example, if you made a Glen plaid black and white suit, you used grey thread that disappeared - that's a Savile Row trademark. As opposed to America, where, if we had a black and white coat, somebody would put on a black buttonhole and then you'd be able to see the buttonhole.BB:Suits were upright and well-constructed, shaped with layers of infrastructure and made to stay that way. Stewart was surgically adept and knew all the tricks, all the ways of giving a man whose shoulders were shaped like a burgundy bottle a square cut silhouette and give a concave chest some muscle.He once showed me a coat he'd made for a man who had a hip removed; the one side pocket had been lined with extra layers of cloth to fill in the missing space.AF:He had an interesting way of drumming up business. He would periodically declare that he was retiring - like a Rolling Stones farewell tour. Everybody understood after two or three times that probably wasn't going to happen, but they would buy a suit.Meledandri (standing) with a customer (1969)On Roland MeledandriAF:Roland Meledandri was his own invention.He made wide-lapel suits, long or even open collar shirts, and wide ties. And this guy, who was literally pencil thin, was wearing clothing which fit within an inch of his life. But the proportions of the clothing were completely different to where everybody else was going.BB:Roland may have been the most influential tailor in NYC in the second half of the Twentieth Century, if for nothing else than - and this is an oft-told tale in the NY garment district - that he inspired Ralph Lauren's favourite coat silhouette.AF:Roland was kind of the model, at the time, for what Ralph became (and in my book,Ralph Lauren: In His Own Fashion, I think I devote a half a page or so to Roland). He was really the first designer, because his look was a designed look. He had real taste - it was a little bit more Italianised than Ralph, who was more Anglified. And he was the first person to feature Ralph's ties at retail.And, to a certain degree, he was a model formy own custom tailor business. Cause he was a guy who didn't come from menswear, but you looked at him and you just wanted to dress like him.Ralph Lauren with his ties (1967)BB:Roland hated the understated campus clothes of the Old Wasps and developed his own sense of what sophisticated guys should wear, based on influences from Fred Astaire to Mr Fish. He liked wider ties and colourful shirts with larger collars, colourful tweed jackets and bold-striped flannel suits in winter and gabardine suits in summer.He took a trad coat and lowered the two-button stance, widened the lapels two inches, deepened the vents the same amount, nipped in the waist and flared the skirt, and straightened the shoulder line a touch for a more rakish look. Trousers were narrow and pleatless, some had Western pockets.AF:Walking into Roland\u2019s was really, for some people, like walking into 346 Madison Avenue at Brooks. I mean, it was really the centre. I think probably the only reason Roland didn't become much larger was that he didn't give a shit what you thought. It was his way or the highway. And his way was generally the right way because he had created this look.A Piero Dimitri suit - GQ (September 1983)On Piero DimitriBB:Piero was a young Italian tailor, from Sicily I think, who brought a decidedly fashionable approach in Manhattan. He preferred to cater to high-end celebrities - I once had a nice chat with Robert Evans, the film producer, at Piero's atelier - who weren't afraid to order a dozen jackets or suits at a time.The house style was narrow and lean with a small soft shoulder and chest, the body narrowing to a close waist and hips. Sleeves were narrow and the preferred style was minimalist with no pocket flaps or vents. Trousers were narrow, Dimitri liked full top pockets and a low-slung waistband.It was styled closer to what the Neapolitan tailors of the day were producing. Elegant, youthful, and international haute couture for men with taste and money.Denzel Washington wearing Leonard Logsdail for the film American Gangster (2007)OnLeonard LogsdailBB:Leonard is a London-trained tailor who came to NYC in the last quarter of the Twentieth Century and has carved out a spot for himself as the most prestigious bespoke maker in town, we might say in the whole country.The house style is quietly tasteful and Mid-Atlantic, the beauty being in the subtlety of shaping and design. Shoulders are moderate and imperceptibly sloped, waists are curved inward and skirts gently flared outward, sleeves unobtrusively tapered, the coat's middle button sits at the waist and the lapels widen to the perfect pitch and width.He also has something of a specialty with gentlemen who want hunting kit such as Norfolk tweed jackets with plus fours and shooting cape or waistcoat, for that little shooting box in Scotland or somewhere in Texas.Leonard Logsdail in his Manhattan studioOn who remainsAF:Most of the tailors we're talking about were older - sixties. So, they were coming to retirement around the same time as this casualisation of clothes occurred.And most of the tailors didn't have a feel for fashion. They were people trained on a bench and from a working-class background. They were set up to do classic, Savile Row-esque clothes. The idea of making something that didn't have a structure or making shirt-sleeve shoulders - it's just not something they knew. Even if they knew how to make it, they didn't understand what kind of fabrics they needed.BB:Apart from Logsdail, none of these men are left. If the name is being used, the business has changed. This is inevitable because great tailoring firms are made by great tailors, tailors not only of incomparable skill, but of vision and personality.The vision comes into play when the tailor sees the style of thezeitgeistbefore him. When he understands how his potential customers want to appear, when he can translate their dreams of themselves into cloth coverings. For the past 50 years more and more men (and some women) who think about such things have gone into design rather than craft.Subway - Bruce Davidson (1980)Bruce Boyer\u2019s new book RIFFS: Random Reflections on Jazz, Blues and Early Rock is scheduled for publication in late spring/early summer.Alan Flusser\u2019s most recent bookRalph Lauren: In His Own Fashionis out now.Manish is@The_Daily_Mirroron InstagramRelated postsHow much do you actually know?

      "body": "By Matthew LongcorePhoto: Brooks Brothers American Made Heritage OCBD Dress ShirtIn an article forThe Wall Street Journal, Hamish Anderson writes:\u201cOxfords are beloved as a super-safe wardrobe staple. Their silhouettes tend to be unfussy. And at their most classic, the shirts are finished with a button-down collar (a style known as the Oxford Cloth Button Down, or OCBD). So preppy are these garments, they conjure images of 1950s Ivy League students sipping Cape Codders and ignoring their exams.\u201dYes indeed, and that\u2019s why we love the Oxford Cloth Button-Down. It is a classic, timeless clothing item that never goes out of style. The article goes on to describe current \u201ctrends\u201d such as the contrast collar, the camp collar, and \u2013 gasp \u2013 no collar at all. Yikes, we surely don\u2019t need that.The Official Preppy Handbook rightfully describes the importance of the OCBD and the collar:\u201cThe classic shirt is the Brooks Brothers button-down all cotton oxford cloth shirt. Pink is the most famous color, and it is widely supposed that no one except Brooks has ever been able to achieve that perfect pink or that perfect roll to the collar.\u201dAs stated in the Preppy Handbook, one should have the OCBD in blue, white, pink, and yellow. An illustration in the Preppy Handbook features the classic OCBD from Brooks Brothers and also shows the J. Press pocket with flap, which is a variation preferred by some preppies.Brooks Brothers,J. Press,The Andover Shop,Mercer & Sons, andO\u2019Connell\u2019sall offer classic Oxford Cloth Button-Down shirts andPolo Ralph Laurenhas a nice version too.Stick to the classics!Related Posts:Brooks Brothers Celebrates 125 Years of the\u2026Brooks Brothers + Preppy Handbook Fan Club GiveawayAnd Now A Word From Ivy Frontman Mr. Kevin Danyi on\u2026English Tweed Suit by Abraham Moon & SonsGatsby at 100: Stylish Old SportThe Duffle Coat - An Ivy ClassicFrom The EditorAmerican rep ties vs. British regimental ties",

      "title": "Five Years Ago \u2014 The Underappreciated Yellow Oxford",
      "body": "This post originally ran five years ago this week.* * *For a certain breed of trad purist, there are only four shirts worth wearing: oxford-cloth button-downs in white, blue, pink and yellow.White and blue are everyday staples of the office wardrobe, and pink is the iconic color, leaving yellow in fourth place, underappreciated, trickier to match, and less flattering. It\u2019s too colorful to be a business basic like blue and white, yet lacks the legendary status of pink.I decided to check with Brooks Brothers merchandiser Jeff Blee to see just howthe yellow oxfordstacks up against its rivals.First off, Jeff had to qualify things: Not every Brooks store is merchandised the same. Some stores only sell white and blue shirts, so yellow isn\u2019t even a choice (ecru, the only other solid oxford available at Brooks, is so obscure as to hardly warrant mentioning).So rather than look at sales companywide, we opted to just look at sales at the Madison Avenue flagship, where the four main solids are stacked right next to each other. Here\u2019s how the sales break down:White: 48%Blue: 38%Pink: 9%Yellow: 5%What do these numbers mean? For one thing, there are almost 10 times as many white shirts sold as yellow. Moreover, there are also nearly twice as many pinks sold as yellow. However, in the South, Blee noted, the margin between pink and yellow is much smaller.Those who are violently allergic to non-iron shirtings will be pleased to learn that sales of must-iron oxford button-downs are growing, according to Blee. The shirts are attracting new customers thanks to Brooks\u2019 new slim and extra-slim fit options. Kudos to Brooks for keeping a classic alive foreveryoneby offering updated variations.But back to the yellow oxford. Why is it less popular? Could it be the color\u2019s connoations of cowardice, envy (as in \u201ca jaundiced eye\u201d), aging (as in yellowed paper), and sensational media (yellow journalism)?I asked sartorial sage Bruce Boyer to opine, and here\u2019s what he said:There are several reasons, I think, why the yellow oxford button-down comes in fourth. Both the white and blue are so extremely serviceable they can be be worn with any outfit. There really don\u2019t seem to be any problems with coordination. The Italians, for example, have figured out that a man can wear a discreet blue shirt with any suit, sports jacket or trouser. And white of course has been a standard for longer than we\u2019ve had white-collar jobs.The pink is a bit more difficult, or perhaps best to saywasmore difficult because in a less enlightened age some men thought that pink anything was effeminate. This is mercifully no longer the case, and its been noticed that pink is a very flattering color with regard to skin tone: It seems to make the skin look healthier somehow.And that is also the reason why yellow isnotso popular: It tends to work best with darker skin tones, making the lighters ones look a bit sallow. And of course there are greater problems of coordination with yellow shirts and ties. It takes a courageous man to wear a yellow oxford button down with a charcoal grey suit. I don\u2019t say its wrong, merely that it takes more than your average bear to pull it off.David Mercer, ofMercer & Sonsshirtmakers, offered this on what to pair a yellow shirt with:Our yellow is a nice faded yellow, unlike the butterscotch yellow of old which faded to its best when you were about to use the shirt for simonizing the car.As Rodney Dangerfield quipped, \u201cWhen I told my dentist my teeth were going yellow, he told me to wear a brown tie.\u201d Personally, navy, blue, green and some red ties all look terrific with our yellow shirt, as does a blue blazer, a blue or grey suit, and many old tweed jackets.There are other ways to wear the yellow oxford. In \u201cDaddy Long Legs\u201d from 1955, we first see Fred Astaire in a scene that magnificently blends the hip and square. Astaire wears a yellow oxford with untied bow tie, while smoking a pipe and drumming along to a jazz record:Moving on, Judge Reinhold wears a yellow oxford with khakis and boat shoes in 1984\u2019s \u201cRoadhouse 66\u201c:A yellow oxford is worn by three characters in \u201cMaking the Grade,\u201d starting with underachiever Palmer Woodrow III, whom we first meet awakening from slumber in his. As with Astaire\u2019s first scene in \u201cDaddy Long Legs,\u201d the yellow shirt can serve as a kind of cinematic shorthand for nonconformist:Later, the prepsploitation flick\u2019s hero Eddie wears one with Go-To-Hell shorts, baby blue polo and pink sweater:And finally, here\u2019s the film\u2019s jerk Biff, who wears a yellow shirt with a navy and red tie and kelly green sweater when learning of his expulsion from prep school:Here are some more outfits with yellow oxfords. First up, Ralph Lauren (clickherefor RL\u2019s oxford):Next: J. Press (whose yellow oxford ishere), from the current season:And finally, as we reach the end of the line, a random shot from theAsk Andy Trad Forum. \u2014 CCRelated Posts:The Oxford Cloth Button-Down is Back.

      "body": "The New OCBD from Brooks.Editor\u2019s Note: Jack Lee is a member of the FB group who posted this review yesterday. I will be posting other reviews as well as they come in, but his perspective is great. \u2013 JB&nbspMy 25th birthday is this week so I decided to treat myself with a trip to the local Brooks Brothers. The collar on my favorite blue university stripe shirt has frayed so bad that I was in need of a replacement and the marketing for Bastain\u2019s new \u201cBrooksier\u201d oxford shirts has been effective on me (following expensive brands on Instagram has not been kind to my wallet). I tried on the small and medium, determined that the small worked best for me, and bought three colors of university stripe: blue, green, and pink.Jack Lee \u2013 Happy Birthday!I am no Brooks oxford expert, but I\u2019ve handled a few of varying ages and fits so I can compare the new shirts to those. I typically wear a 15-34 Regent fit and the new shirts remind me of that fit. The sleeve is shorter, measured at 33.5 inches before washing, and in my experience Brooks shirts typically shorten about an inch after a few rounds in the washer and dryer so I\u2019ve been hang drying these to maintain the longer sleeve. I tried on the medium (the pink stripe fitting room pic) but the fit was too billowy and long for my taste. I could have had them all tailored but I didn\u2019t want to spend the extra money.The new OCBD in a classic setting.The material is actually fairly substantial and feels firmer than some of the older MIUSA Brooks shirts I own. The collar holds its shape throughout the day and has a pleasant roll when worn without a tie, although I didn\u2019t see much roll when I put on a tie. The collar point measures 3.25 inches. I love the colors I bought, especially the green and pink because they seem to be rare for university stripe. The blue is a shade lighter than the shirt it was replacing and not as rich in color, but it\u2019s still nicer than other brands I\u2019ve owned. The cuffs have two buttons, whereas my others only have one.Pros:* Price is $90, which is just slightly more than what I used to pay for J. Crew shirts of much lower quality.* The color selection is great. I love that I could find the pink and green.* The fit isn\u2019t too big or too small, but this is specific to me as a 5\u201910, 145lb person.* The collar has a nice roll, but it looks better without a tie.* A front pocket! Why did they take these off to begin with?Cons:* These are made in Vietnam. You can get some good quality products out of Asia, but there\u2019s still something appealing about an iconic American company making products in America.* S,M,L,XL sizing makes it harder to get a perfect fit. I know that the sleeves will eventually shrink on these and be too short.Overall I like these shirts and might include a few new colors on this year\u2019s Christmas list. I hope this is helpful to anyone curious about the new shirts. Let me know if I can answer questions.Related Posts:Brooks Brothers + Preppy Handbook Fan Club GiveawayAnd Now A Word From Ivy Frontman Mr. Kevin Danyi on\u2026The Oxford Cloth Button-Down is Back.

      "title": "The Button-Down Mind Set",
      "body": "GQ\u2019s Style Guy advice column once had the following curious exchange apropos of our collar of choice. A reader asked columnist Glenn O\u2019Brien the following:I heard somebody refer to a button-down-collar oxford shirt as \u201cmiddle-management\u201d the other day. I always thought the oxford was the great American shirt. Have I been sending the wrong message all this time?First off, the reader sounds like he works in some kind of \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d milieu. \u201cMiddle management\u201d is probably a fair epithet if your ambition is to be a Master of the Universe.O\u2019Brien\u2019s response to the reader was this:Some say that JFK wore button-downs with suits until Jackie crticized him for it, and then he began to get on the case of the guys on his team, like Bobby Kennedy and Paul Fay, telling them they looked too Ivy League. The button-down is the shirt equivalent of the loafer. You can wear it with a suit, but only when you\u2019re dressing your suit down.Fair enough. The content of this part was possibly found from Ivy-Style.com, which supplies 18 of the top 20 Google results for the search query \u201cJFK button down oxford.\u201d But hey, that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.He went on to write:Many American men mistake the button-down-collar shirt for a dress shirt, especially when it\u2019s white, and this misjudgment is often found in high places, from corproate suits to Congress.You can see why I thought you guys might enjoy sinking your teeth into this one. If only more businessmen and politicos wore oxford-cloth buttondowns! Perhaps they\u2019d start wearing natural-shouldered suits to match, and we\u2019d all have more to choose from.And yes, the buttondown oxford may have been a sport shirt for polo players in England 120 years ago, but we \u2014 or rather Brooks Brothers \u2014 made it an American dress shirt.Continuing:I think the button-down-dress-up thing started as a preppy affectation.I can certainly see what he\u2019s suggesting. The shirt probably was embraced for its rumpled casualness, but why must that be an affectation? I think the entire WASPy/preppy/Ivy approach to dressing \u2014 being relatively dressed up with casual attire and relatively dressed down with formal attire \u2014 is one of its greatest virtues. Can\u2019t that simply emanate from a set of values, one in which the shirt\u2019s heartiness and longevity, not to mention versatility (dress it up, dress it down, wear it over a polo when a sweater would be too much) speak to WASPdom\u2019s reverence for utility?Besides, affectation is almost unheard of among the original arbiters of oxford-cloth buttondowns. And when they paired them with whale-embroided chinos, they were being whimsical but they were also being \u201ccorrect.\u201d There\u2019s no such thing as WASP irony or affectation \u2014 save for the affectation of being unaffected.Speaking of \u201cbutton-down mind set,\u201d which is the title GQ gives to the Q&A exchange, it\u2019s high time we acknowledge Bob Newhart and his best-selling 1960 comedy album \u201cThe Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart.\u201d My dad had this and I discovered it as a kid when I first started sifting through his record collection. I was too young to appreciate it, but I remember liking the driving instructor bit:Here Newhart discusses how the album came about, and how he needed Warner Brothers, who had chosen the title, to explain it to him. They explained, of course, that it was a reference to the men of Madison Avenue who worked in fields like advertising and all wore buttondown collars. \u2014 CCRelated Posts:Brooks Brothers Celebrates 125 Years of the\u2026The Oxford Cloth Button-Down is Back.

Press White Oxford Dress Shirt \u2013 The Principal Piece in any Ivy wardrobe.Editor\u2019s Note: All shirts were dry cleaned with light starch at an eco-friendly dry cleaner and delivered on a hanger, not folded. The same ties and suit will be worn across the board so that you can compare apples to apples. All images were, to my tremendous humility, posted without a filter so you can see what is.I present the J. Press White Oxford Dress Shirt. The tasting notes: this is a dress shirt. It collaborates with a tie perfectly. There are shirts that, when engaging a tie, do not move. This shirt is as comfortable with the ties shown as open collar. More about how the J. Press Oxford is one of the crown jewels in a second, but first I have to tell you, this shirt wears as well as any shirt you will ever own. It reads distinction, it looks like you spent money, but what J. Press has done here is create an Oxford that carries itself with as much comfort as the pedigree it represents. I roll my sleeves up almost immediately at work, with this shirt I forgot to. There is no mistaking this shirt as department store, and there is no confusion about its intent. This is a dress shirt that demonstrates formality while the experience of it is informal.Let\u2019s skip to the end. The J. Press White OCBD (hereafter referred to as the \u201cWOCBD\u201d) was not always the first WOCBD you thought of. But I am looking at a pile of samples here, it is impossible to do a review without a relative comparison, and the J. Press WOCBD has ascended to the throne as it were. This may not be the only choice for everyone, but you cannot build a classic Ivy wardrobe for men without at least one.The elephant in the room is of course the BB WOCBD. We are only comparing what you can buy new today. Of course, there were decades where the WOCBD ASSUMPTION was BB. But we know what happened. And we as a market have given Brooks a chance to respond, and we have reviewed them, and we have paid homage. It is time to move on.From the Dalai Lama: Open your arms to change, but don\u2019t let go of your values.The collar roll. Here is the shirt unbuttoned without a tie, so you can see as pure a roll as possible:Remember, this is UNFILTERED and I am getting a new dog today and the Super Bowl started at 6:30. I am tired.So the collar roll is very much perfect. Very much. The shirt come in classic fit, meaning it suits adults who have had bread within the last week. The shirt isn\u2019t listed as non-iron specifically, but the directions are to wash and iron if necessary. 100% cotton of course, but no non-iron sheen to it at all. The shirt FEELS IVY. It moves Ivy. The design of the shirt, you can feel the legacy. There are not ways to substitute this. Eyes have been laid on this shirt, eyes that have also seen the real Ivy League.Here is the shirt with a tie, so that you can see the spread. I will use the same tie and same four-in-hand throughout the series so you can tell apples to apples. As you can see, the collar length frames the tie with the exact Ivy scale.The buttons have a pearl finish and are smooth securely sewn. The button holes are also reinforced with stitching. Here is the shirt juxtaposed with a suit jacket:That roll is not because I arranged it for the photo, that is how the shirt naturally postures itself.The bow tie is far from dead, and the J. Press WOCBD is the perfect canvas for it:Finally, the shirt at the end of the day:The tails are long enough to stay tucked in all day (mine did a solid 8 hours) but if you want that I-never-completely-dress-down-for-anything jam that I like, leaving it on in the evening untucked is a wonderful presentation to raise a 14 year old daughter who wants to go on her first date with. She went. So did I. Shirt performed perfectly, as did her suitor.J. Press is REMARKABLY consistent. There were some disturbing inconsistencies in the pairs of shirts that we tested, but J. Press issues the same shirt twice. Thankfully. In terms of value, the shirt retails for $135, and you can order them if youclick here. There are places to cut cornerstones, but your dress WOCBD\u2019s are NOT included amongst them. I have sampled every WOCBD I can get my hands on, and some discount and department store lines are somewhat indistinguishable from the blue ribbon. None of them are in this category. This shirt is noticeably superior even to the untrained eye.The buttons are equidistant, so you can be comfortable with the collar unbuttoned. The shirt is made in the USA. Oh, here\u2019s the back:Conclusion: The reign of BB and its WOCBD is over. There are equals to the J. Press WOCBD, but there are no shirts better. The shirt is not elitist in price point so beginners can treat themselves to several, and those with a few more years out of school under our belts should consider the J. Press White Oxford and The Fundamental to the Ivy wardrobe now. You need to collect some diverse brands for different uses, but you cannot be authentically Ivy with this shirt.Related Posts:The Oxford Cloth Button-Down is Back.

The caveat here is that theindigothey are dyed in may not.One of the biggest appeals of raw denim is that it will conform and fade to your body the longer you wear it. The reason your jeans fade along with what you do in them is because they are losing indigo in the places they naturally abrade: where they fold behind your knees, when you scrape them on the concrete, against your wallet in your back pocket. The more indigo you have to lose, the greater the eye-popping contrast between those natural stress points and the rest of the jean will be.A pair of well faded jeans.When you wash your jeans, however, you lose indigo throughout the entirety of the jean, so the resulting fade will have less contrast. The flipside here is that the longer you wait to wash your jeans, the more that dirt and grime will build up within the fabric and the more brittle and stretched out the cotton fibers will be and the more likely your jeans will start toblow outand rip apart.If it\u2019s just a small stain, you might be able to get away withspot cleaning. Ultimately though, if you\u2019re ever in doubt, you should probably wash your jeans. For me, that\u2019s about every 3-4 months of moderate wear. Some people who only wear their jeans on the weekends can go for years, while people who are very active and wear their jeans everyday can barely wait a month. If you\u2019re still unsure, have a look at our guide to6 Signs You Should Probably Wash Your Jeans.Once you\u2019re ready to say it\u2019s time for a wash though, read on for how to do it right.Like this?

The waist on sanforized jeans will eventually stretch back out, but what you lose in inseam length will not.If you hem your jeans before the first wash, please keep this in mind or you might have the snazziest pair of denim flood pants around.Temperature\u2013 The warmer the water, the more indigo you will lose and the more the denim will shrink. This is true for any sort of wash.Indigo Transfer\u2013Don\u2019t wash your jeans with anything that you don\u2019t intend to dye blue!Raw denim naturally bleeds indigo\u2013it\u2019s how you get your fades\u2013but it hemorrhages when it\u2019s wet. If you\u2019re washing your jeans in the tub, be ready for a little blue porcelain.Clean your Washing Area\u2013 Make sure your tub is clean and free of chemicals or your washing machine has nothing but the detergent you are using to wash your jeans loaded up. More than a few pairs of jeans have bleached, stained, and everything in between from gunk hanging around.How to Wash Your Raw DenimEveryone has their own method of washing their jeans that they get just right. Below is our straightforward way that\u2019s easy to use and will give you fresh jeans with minimal indigo loss in under 10 steps:Run a cool-lukewarm bath and add your soap. We recommend ourDenim Wash, but most soaps and detergents will do.Wait for the soap to be completely dissolved in the water and place your jeans in the tub. Turn off the water when there\u2019s enough for the jeans to be completely submerged (around 3-4 inches).Agitate the jeans under the water for a few minutes then place them so that all parts of the jean are under water. You may have to use shampoo bottles to hold it down if your jeans are especially buoyant.Leave your jeans in the tub for 30-45 minutes (or just watch our Ueno shop tour video five times).Agitate your jeans one more time and then drain the tub.Once the tub is completely empty, refill it with again with cold water and leave the jeans in it for another 5-10 minutes. This will rinse out any remaining soap.Drain the tub and hang your jeans to dry over the drain or outside\u2013they will drip indigo water for a while.Let them dry overnight and voila\u2013clean jeans!Alternate MethodsWe personally go for the tub wash, but not everyone shares that sentiment noreven owns a tub. Here are a couple other methods you might have heard about and why we think the tub soak is the best method out there.Washing Machine\u2013 Quite a few people simply toss their jeans in the washing machine, which is a perfectly valid and probably more sanitary way to wash your pants. The caveat here is that the way you earn your fades in your raw denim is through the creases that set into the denim. Washing machines tumble, spin, and agitate, which could not only remove those creases but also add a few of their own. If you do choose to wash with a machine though, DO NOT PUT THEM IN THE DRYER. The dryer will shrivel your jeans into a raw denim raisin with a host of weird new creases.Dry Cleaning\u2013 Some people swear by taking their jeans to the cleaners, after all, how can your jeans shrink if they never even touch water? That may be well and good, but the dry cleaner will be more expensive than anything at home, you won\u2019t know what chemicals they\u2019re using on your jeans, and you have to really trust them as some cleaners might just toss them in their industrial washer and dryer instead.Ocean Washing\u2013 Theocean washtrend used to be much more popular, but it\u2019s still not uncommon to see someone taking their jeans for a day at the beach. Rubbing sand and seawater on your pants may increase the fades, but it is not an acceptable or hygienic way to wash them. If you choose to do an ocean wash, you\u2019ll need to wash again in freshwater or risk smelling like low tide.Step-by-Step Video on How To Wash Your Denim",

If by chance you fall into this bucket, there are a few things you should take into account when you decide to take the plunge. Note, as well, that pinpointing the \u201cperfect pair\u201d is never an easy feat. There are so many attractive options on the market, not to mention brands offer a multitude of fits and fabrics.Right off the bat, the easiest and best solution is to head to a brick-and-mortar store that offers a healthy range of raw denim and is run by knowledgeable staff. This should give you an excellent opportunity to try a lot of different pairs as well soak in advice given by someone who knows their trade.The fact remains though that raw denim is still not always easy to obtain, and the internet is the only option many people are left with. Finding the goods on the web is not a problem at all, but many people struggle with the unknown and end up in a dilemma with a lot of unanswered questions.To help you through some of the basic challenges you may encounter, we walk through the denim buying process in five simple steps:Choose your silhouetteKnow your measurementsSanforized or unsanforizedPicking the right sizeDetermine your budget & go shoppingBut First, What is Raw Denim?Close-ups of raw denim by Japanese label, Big John, via Hinoya.To make denim, cotton yarns are dyed with indigo, cured, and then woven into a denim fabric on a loom. Raw denim is the name given to fabrics that are taken straight off the loom, not washed or processed. Raw denim can be identified through its stiff texture. Denim mills typically add a starch-like substance in a process known as \u2018sizing\u2019 which makes improves the strength, drape, and overall quality of the dye cotton yarns, as well as making them easier to weave into denim. As raw denim hasn\u2019t been washed after this process, it remains stiff and starchy, requiring the wearer to \u2018break it in\u2019.Breaking in raw denim jeans is part of the charm and allure of raw denim. Raw denim jeans mold to their wearer, forming a pattern of fades and creases that are unique to their wearer. For a full rundown on raw denim itself, check outThe Essential Raw Denim Breakdown: Our 100th Article.1. Choose Your SilhouetteChoosing the right silhouette for your first pair of raw denim jeans is essential. You need a fit that\u2019s going to work with your body shape and style, leading to a pair that you\u2019ll want to wear every day \u2013 exactly how raw denim should be worn.Jeans fall into the following silhouette categories with the following typical traits:Like this? Read these:Leather Coin Cases \u2013 Five Plus OneThe Heddels Last-Minute Holiday Gift Guide 2018Straight leg\u2013 A class straight leg silhouette that isn\u2019t baggy nor slim, just a simple straight silhouette with no heavy taper or flare. The lap and seat areas should be trim but skin-hugging, accentuating your figure without clinging to it. The hem opening at the bottom of the jeans will be in the mid-range, meaning you can wear the jeans over pretty much any footwear.Slim straight\u2013 Still straight, but narrower throughout the leg with a slightly slimmer thigh area. The hem opening at the bottom will also be narrower, which is something to be considered.Slim tapered\u2013 The slimmest form of jeans, also known as \u2018tight tapered\u2019. This category covers skinny raw denim jeans, too. They differ from the slim straight in that the knee down is heavily tapered, resulting in the lower portion of the jeans hugging the leg more. Slim tapered jeans will have the narrowest leg opening, so consider this if you want your hem to be worn over boots.Relax tapered\u2013 Like slim tapered but with a roomier top block for people with larger thighs/butt, or those who simply want more room and comfort in that area of the jean.Wide straight\u2013 Like the straight leg, wide straight jeans have no taper but also have a roomier top block for a wider silhouette throughoutBootcut\u2013 Slim straight but with a gentle flare towards the hem to accommodate the wearing of boots.2. Know Your MeasurementsAfter deciding what silhouette you want to purchase, you need to establish your measurements. One of the easiest ways to do this is to take one of your own pairs of denim or pants that have what you consider to be an ideal fit. From the images below you can see what measurements are required when buying a pair of raws by utilizing a simple tape measure. You can then use these measurements to follow the next steps in this guide and inform your purchase.While you\u2019ll still want to double-check the measurements with the retailer (particularly if you\u2019re purchasing online), below is the common seven-point criterion to get you moving in the right direction.Waist (Band)Based upon this pair of LVC 501, the denim measures approximately 16\u201d, or 32\u2033 total (note: tape not laid flat in image)Lay your denim on a flat surface and pull the front waistband up so that it is on the same level as the rear waistband. Measure your waistband from left to right and multiply by 2 to find your waist size.InseamInseam measurement in this case is 34\u2019\u2019 (note: tape above not measured exactly from crotch)Start with your tape in the center of the crotch and measure alongside the inseam until you reach the hem.Leg opening/hemThe leg opening measurement of this pair is 8.5\u2019\u2019To measure the leg opening, place the front and the back of the hem in line so that they are on the same level. Now measure the width of the hem.Upper ThighThe upper thigh here measures 12\u2019\u2019Measure horizontally from the crotch to the outside of the leg as shown in the image above.KneeThe knee of this pair measures 9.5\u2033Start with your measuring tape in the center of the crotch and measure 13\u201d downwards, along the inseam.From this point turn your tape horizontally and measure the width of the leg. This will give you your knee measurement.Front riseThe measurement here is 12\u2019\u2019Measure vertically from the crotch to the top of the waistband with your denim facing up.Back RiseThe back rise on this pair is 14\u2033Measure vertically from the crotch to the top of the waistband with your denim facing down.3. Sanforized or UnsanforizedBefore you move forward on any one specific denim, you\u2019ll want to know whether the denim is sanforized or unsanforized as both options call for different sizing methods. We previously published anarticle on sanforizationwhich makes for a useful reference in fully understanding the sanforization process. To re-cap though, the basics of (un)sanforization follow below.SanforizedMost raw denim is sanforized, meaning that they\u2019ve been treated with water once to avoid any shrinking that may have occured during your first wash. When buying a sanforized pair, although they how will stretch roughly 0.5\u2033 \u2013 1.0\u2033 with wear, bear in mind that they will shrink roughly 1% \u2013 5% and you will need to size down accordingly.UnsanforizedWhile more uncommon, numerous vintage brands still utilize unsanforized denim. Implied within the name, this is raw denim that has not undergone the sanforization process and thus will shrink a fair amount when they are washed or soaked for the first time. Most pairs will shrink about 7% \u2013 10% which could be 1.5 to 3 inches in total, if not more. Due to this immense shrinkage, one often sizes up so that the denim won\u2019t be too tight or short after theinitial soak.4. Picking The Right SizeAt this point, you\u2019re likely starting to really hone in on a few makes and models of raw denim jeans. Before jumping ahead though, you\u2019ll want to combine steps 2 and 3 above in order to determine the optimal size you need. This is sometimes as easy as referencing a sizing table on the site (note this is not always 100% reliable) or emailing the store.In general, though, it will boil down to three options:True to Size (TTS)Buying the size tag that has the closest measurements compared to yours.Sizing DownBuying one or more size tags smaller than what you currently measure. This is typically the case when buying a denim that stretches a lot and/or you know you\u2019ll be wearing heavily. The caveat with tight-fitting denim is that they are more prone toblowouts, but if you\u2019ve done your homework well enough (see step five), this will be an easy decision.Sizing UpBuying one size tag or more larger than the size that compares to your measurements. This could be the case with denim that is very sturdy/strong/tough and has little to no stretch, denim that is smaller and tighter in certain areas, and/or denim that is unsanforized or shrink-to-fit.5. Determine Your Budget & Go ShoppingIt goes without saying that most pairs of raw denim jeans are quality items, superior to their washed-out, mass-produced counterparts. Raw denim andselvedge denimtypically go hand in hand, too, with raw selvedge denim arguably being the pinnacle of quality denim fabrics.Raw denim is durable and can last you for years assuming it is maintained and treated well. The weight of the denim is an important aspect that determines the quality and durability of a pair. For this reason, the higher-weight denim (17 oz. and up) are traditionally more expensive. There is also a big difference between handcrafted jeans and those made in a mass-production factory. Some brands make their denim by hand and in small batches, a time-consuming process but one that can give the denim a story and more character.The price for a decent pair of raw denim starts around $80.00 and can go up as high as $2,000.00 in the exorbitant case of theMomotarohandwoven G001-T Gold. Think about what you are willing to pay for a pair of raw denim and try to stay in your price range. For a few examples, see our lists ofraw denim under 100 dollars,between 100 and 200 dollars, andbetween 200 and 350 dollars. Our article,The Three Tiers of Raw Denimcan also help you decipher the differences between raw denim pricing.This last step is completely personal and depends on your taste and style. What color denim do you like? Do you like visible rear pocketarcuatesor would you like them to be clean and simple? Consider step 1 in this guide to create your shortlist.Nearly every brand has a few different styles and fits. Pick a few that suit you best and attain as much information as you need to make the decision comfortable.In essence, although buying your first pair of raw denim can sometimes be a daunting process, it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be. We believe following this succinct five-step guide is a great approach to getting the job done right the first time, but if you have another process, let us know through the comments below.FAQsQ: I can\u2019t find any raw denim jeans with my inseam measurement, what\u2019s going on there?A:Raw denim jeans are often made with longer inseams of 35\u2033 and up, thus will need to be hemmed by a tailor or cuffed to your desired length. This is a nod to old-school traditions of raw denim where folks had to shrink jeans to fit them. Longer inseams allowed for shrinkage and made the jeans universal.We recommend hemming any raw denim jeans even if it\u2019s just taking off 2-3\u2033. Leave a sufficient amount of fabric if you want to cuff them, but cuffing over 3-4 times can look sloppy.Bear in mind that not many tailors have a chain stitch machine, so if you want to retain thechain stitchedquality of your hem, ask the retailer if they offer this service or send your jeans toFranklin & Poe.Q: I bought some unsanforized jeans that need to be pre-soaked before I wear them. What do I do?A:We have an article on soaking,here, but all you need to do is soak them in a tub of warm water for 1-2 hours before patting them dry with a large towel and hang-drying them in a warm environment.Q: Whilst looking at raw denim jeans online, I see the term \u2018one wash\u2019 in some product descriptions. What does this mean?A:One-wash is the name given to a gentle washing process that denim makers will use on a finished raw denim garment to remove the shrink and soften the fabric slightly. This process means you can wear your product right out of the box, as opposed to pre-soaking it yourself. So, if a pair of jeans areunsanforizedbut one wash, you can wear them straight away without soaking them, as the one wash process ave covered this for you.For more on this subject, check outOne Wash Denim \u2013 Is It Still Raw?Q: Can raw denim jeans be black or other colors?A:Yes. Raw denim is iconically indigo, but it can be any color.Q: My lifestyle means my jeans will get dirty pretty quickly, but I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re not meant to wash raw denim. Is this true?A: Whilst it is common for people to refrain from washing their raw denim jeans, it isn\u2019t a necessary practice. You can still earn decent fades with regular laundering. Try not to overthink this part of raw denim and remember that your jeans are supposed to reflect your lifestyle.Japanese denim legend Yoshiyuki Hayashi is an advocate of the frequent wash, as discussed in our article,In Defense of the Frequent Wash.Q: For personal reasons, I need some elasticity in my jeans.

      "body": "For most, denim is a wardrobe staple. For some, it\u2019s an investment. Regardless of which camp you fall into, your jeans are probably one of the hardest working garments in your closet and as a result, they tend to take a beating. If you want to maximize your cost-per-wear, you\u2019re going to need to be ready to shell out for repairs. Whether you\u2019ve got a pair of $60Levi\u2019sor $300 Japanese imports, the guidelines for dutiful upkeep remain the same. While denim is designed to be durable, it\u2019s not indestructible\u2013except maybe for the 125 year old pair seen above.Remember, a well-loved pair of jeans can fetch a pretty penny\u2014just take a look at the price tag associated withA.P.C.\u2019s pre-worn Butler series\u2014so be sure to take good care of yours once you\u2019ve put in the time to break them in.Before the buy:1. Get the right sizeThis should go without saying, but it\u2019s been the bane of a lot of people\u2019s introduction to raw denim. Different brands fit differently (some run big, some run small). By the same token, some brands will shrink after your first wash and others will give with wear. If your jeans are too small, it will lead to more abrasion and quicker blowouts, not to mention threaten your unborn children. It\u2019s really important when you\u2019re shopping around that you speak with sales assistants that are personally familiar with the nuances of fit associated with the brands they represent.2. Buy rawAt the risk of preaching to the choir, you should buy raw denim. If you want long-lasting denim, there\u2019s no sense in buying a pair that\u2019s already had a year of life sandblasted off of them.3. Go heavyweightNaked & Famous 32 Oz. Heavyweight Raw DenimThe reason denimheads fetishize the weight of their denim is because the higher the count, the longer the wear and the better the fades. So, if you really want to put your jeans through the ringer, go heavyweight (anything above 16oz). More cotton simply means there\u2019s more for you to work through.After the buy:4. Wash your jeansLevi\u2019s CEO Chip Bergh recently went on the record saying that he tries to avoid washing his jeans as much as possible. His point was to highlight the fact that most times, consumers wash their jeans too frequently and waste water in the process. While his heart is certainly in the right place, the headline-grabbing iteration of his \u201cDirty Jeans Manifesto\u201d was rife with misinformation. To set the record straight, Bergh conceded that there is a lot of debate about how to best care for your jeans and that he does not consider himself a spokesman for proper denim care.Like this? Read these:A Heddels Haunted Halloween AlphabetThe Great Escape: Working TitlesThat being said, you should most certainly wash your jeans (if you want them to last longer). If you don\u2019t, your denim will absorb all the dirt, grime, and sweat that comes with wear, creating harmful friction, that will wear down the cotton. When it comes time to wash your jeans, spot-clean first, as not all stains warrant an all-over wash. Also, be sure to wash them using cold water, with a non-abrasive detergent (if necessary at all). Select the gentle or delicate cycle setting if you choose to use a washing machine or put them in the tub. Check out our full breakdown ofwashing methods.5. Hang dry themIf you take anything from this article, it\u2019s that you shouldn\u2019t put your jeans in the dryer! Subjecting your jeans to high heat causes shrinkage (which increases stress points), expedites the breakdown of the cotton fibers, and can cause some really funky new creases. Once you\u2019ve finished washing, be sure to either: hang dry, roll, or lay your jeans flat.6. Be diligent about repairCrotchblowouts, busted button-holes, pocket bag wear, and frayed hems are all common plights associated with well-worn denim. We\u2019ve written extensively about how to combat each of these maladiesbefore they wreck havoc, but if you let slip, just be sure to take them to someone whoknows what they\u2019re doing. An ounce of prevention is often worth a pound of cure, as a those small tears will grow exponentially and may send your jeans to an early retirement if they are left unchecked.7. Keep \u2019em in rotationDon\u2019t succumb to the urge to wear the same pair of jeans week-in and week-out. Even though your jeans may have cost enough to buy a pair from the Gap for every day of the week, it doesn\u2019t make indestructible. As with Goodyear-welted shoes, you should do your best to avoid wearing the same pair for days or weeks at a time. It will give your jeans a chance to wear and dry out.Even if you follow all of these tips, your jeans will eventually fade away, but hopefully this info will help you slow down the process.",

It\u2019s that kind of deliciousness that has you eating that burger with a fervor that makes your friends a little embarrassed for you and it doesn\u2019t even matter to you. This is the best moment of your life until you look down and realize that there are a couple drops of ketchup and meat juice on your jeans that you JUST washed. Crap. What do you do now?Raw denim and water have had a strained relationship at best. If you look at any forum, website (including ours), or really anywhere that talks about raw denim, you\u2019ll undoubtedly find people sharing their fears of having their jeans touch water whenit\u2019s time to cleanthem.The fear of water, mostly fueled by articles talking about how you should never wash so you can achieve maximumsick fades, has somewhat decreased as more and more people gain experience with raw denim and wash their jeans without experiencing catastrophe. However, there is a little ambiguity of how to clean, specifically spot clean, when you only need to clean a small part of the jeans so we thought let\u2019s get this in writing and put together aHeddelsguide to spot cleaning.1. Don't Freak OutWipe away those manly tears or those \u201cmeat sweats\u201d. It\u2019s going to be ok.2. Remove Any Residue and Wet the AreaIt\u2019ll be important to wipe off any of the excess stuff on your jeans so that it doesn\u2019t have a chance to set or stain any further. Using a wet towel (cloth is better but paper towel is fine as long but just be mindful of it leaving paper residue while you\u2019re cleaning) with any kind of soap, gently wipe to get the remaining residue off and and dab the spot to get some water to soak in.3. Allow it to dryAfter the stain looks gone, let it air dry.When the fabric looks relatively wet or the stain looks mostly gone, let it air dry. With minor stains, these quick steps should be enough to minimize the staining. If not, proceed to step 4.4. Repeat Steps 1 Through 3Brian McKnight. If you don't know who he is, listen to Brian McKnight - Back At One and thank me later.Use powered detergent or a small amount of liquid detergent that you'd normally use.All joking aside, sometimes repeating the process can remove the remaining stains. Alternatively, if the stain is a little deeper, saturate the stained area again with tepid water and then use a little bit of powered detergent or a little liquid detergent that you\u2019d normally use to wash your jeans and lightly rub it into the stain.After a couple minutes, wash it out and let it air dry one more time.5. Wear Your Jeans!Stevenson 727 after a lot of wear. No stains visible!As with any weird creasing from storage or washing, the more you wear your jeans, the more the stain will disappear. As long as the stain isn\u2019t obvious or smells, just start wearing the jeans again.Remember, part of the reason you bought jeans was so that all the fading and wear marks on the jeans are made by you and stains are part of that story. So embrace anything that happens while you\u2019re wearing the jeans and maybe use more napkins next time.",

Stated simply, we aim to keep you from having to spend hours combing through forums\u2019 less-than-amazing search resultsand spare you the the wrath of their usersfor the information you need about raw denim.Today, we hope to save you from the agonizing pain of deciphering awful Google Translate results to get information off of Japanese sites. The following is our translation of thewashing guideonSamurai Jeans Co.\u2019sofficial site. (You can also check out ourcomplete guide to washing raw denim jeansand pick up a bottle of ourDenim Wash.)Note:In Japanese, the terms for \u201csoak\u201d and \u201cwash\u201d, as we designate them in English, are interchangeable. Anything in parentheses is a note from the translator.Look like Moonspeak to you? Fear not!Samurai Jeans Co. \u2013 Washing AdviceRegarding The First WashThe first wash (or \u201cinitial soaking\u201d in English) is primarily done to \u201cde-starch\u201d the jeans, and is also used to control shrinkage.When you first purchase your jeans they will be very stiff due to the starch added during the manufacturing process. Initially, it is not recommended that you wear your jeans until you wash them with water to make them more comfortable. It will also decrease the extent of any irregularities in the denim.Also, as the denim is initially \u201crigid\u201d (The English term is used), please note that unique twisting may occur during the first soak. (We call thisleg-twistin English)StepsFirst off, turn the jeans inside out. Place the jeans in warm water.Air will be contained within the denim; this cannot be helped. Hold down the jeans for approximately 10 minutes to soak the cotton thoroughly and release the air trapped within. Afterwards, you should be able to leave them be. If the jeans continue to rise to the surface after 10 minutes, do not worry. Soaking the jeans for 1-2 hours is adequate. At most, 24 hours is the longest they should be soaked for.Indigo dye will be released from the denim and will change the colour of the water. Machine washes will emphasize this colour-loss. Of course, hand-washing is OK as well.At the time of the first wash detergent is not necessary, however, if one decides to use detergent please ensure it is free of fluorescent (???) additives or bleach. OurKaminari (Thunder) Soapcontains no additives and is perfect for washing jeans.***For very heavy-ounce denim, it will remain extremely stiff. To soften, we recommend turning the jeans inside out and using a washing machine.Rinse the jeans thoroughly.Providing a washing machine was used, it is best to use the spin-cycle while the jeans remain inside-out.When the spin-cycle is finished, turn the jeans right-side-out, smooth out any wrinkles and hang-dry in the shade.Samurai Jeans Co.does not recommend using a dryer machine, but if one so chooses, please be aware of the heat and the length of time used to dry. The jeans may shrink beyond normal or the denim may soften too much, so please be careful if you choose to use the dryer.Please use the above method as a guideline, and not as a rule. Steps will vary for those who choose a fully-automated wash, and some people prefer to leave their jeans unwashed. We believe that everyone washes in their own way. It is best to try different methods to discover one\u2019s own personal style of washing their jeans.Please wear your favouriteSamuraijeans with love forever.Like this?

      "body": "Even though scores of raw denim enthusiasts are focused on achievingcrazy fades, there is a small subset of people who want to preserve the dark look of their jeans by stopping them from fading. These people may love the quality and beautiful selvedge that can come with raw denim, but not always the inevitable loss of that minimalist, clean look.Maybe as a surprise to some, there are actually quite a few strategies for maintaining a dark color. Though this is the opposite of what most raw denim enthusiasts are interested in, you have to respect the moxie of those who go through the trouble.Soak in water and white vinegarBesides being used toget the funk out of clothing, white vinegar can also be used to \u201cset\u201d the indigo dye in a pair of jeans.By mixing it with water (about a half cup for a tub full) and soaking the pair of jeans, the wearer can limit further rub-off and fades. Although this only qualifies as a soak, white vinegar is a good option for those who are fine with not fully-washing their jeans.Hand wash with Woolite DarkWoolite Dark is already renowned as the go-to detergent for washing raw denim, so it should come as no surprise to see it on this list.If you absolutely must wash your jeans and you want to keep the darkest color possible, a small amount of Woolite Dark and a tub of water provide the ideal soaking environment. It should come as common sense that if you\u2019re trying to limit fades, avoid the washing machine and its agitating spin cycle at all costs.Iron regularly to prevent creasesAreas that crease on raw denim are usually the first places that fading appears; the crotch, behind the knee, and the seat are the obvious ones that come to mind.If the wearer irons out these creases after every wear, they can help minimize fading in those areas. The downside of this strategy is that it\u2019s time-consuming and takes a lot of dedication. However, if you\u2019re dead-set on minimizing fades, anything is on the table.Buy jeans that don't fadeMaybe the easiest tip on this list is to just buy jeans that don\u2019t fade. Unfortunately, they come at a price and are especially rare.Pure Blue Japan, a brand well-known for their easily-fading denim, make a pair called theNC-005. The \u201cNC\u201d stands for \u201cNo Change,\u201d meaning the denim is a fabric that won\u2019t fade. The science behind the pair is that they\u2019re dyed withindanthrene, a water-insoluble dye. The dye is commonly used in military clothing, since it is renowned for lasting through the harsh sun and countless washes.PBJ notes that the jeans will show very slight signs of wear, but will not fade to a lighter blue like regular indigo-dyed jeans. If this option suits you, they\u2019re available for the wallet-busting price of$315.Refrain from strenuous activityThe last, and perhaps most sad option, is to limit the level of activity in your jeans. Getting brunch with friends? You\u2019ll have to sit down at the table and risk creasing the back your knees. Have to walk your dog? You can\u2019t risk walking that much.We\u2019re of course kidding here, but it highlights a certain point\u2013that you should probably just live your life and stop worrying about your jeans. You can do some things to minimize fading, but stressing about every little detail removes most of the joy behind why you bought them in the first place.",

So I sought through trouser suits, trench coats, tuxedos, and pea coats to give women the same confidence.\u201d \u2014 Yves Saint LaurentWithout using the term \u201cpower suit,\u201d Saint Laurent identified theessenceof the power suit as a garment that both creates and exudes confidence in and from the wearer. And while the term likely brings to minda traditional combination of a navy suit, crisp white shirt and bright red tie, there\u2019s much more to the power suit than any single color combination, fabric or cut.Today I want to share how the underrated gray suit deserves a prominent place in the power suit conversation. Let\u2019s dive in.What Is a Power Suit?For better or worse, one\u2019s appearance typically delivers the first impression. Because of this, the power suit is the go-to uniform for many of life\u2019s biggest professional moments. When one wants to both feel and express confidence, capability and control, there\u2019s nothing better than a power suit.As with everything, the proper power suit starts with the perfect fit. Suits traditionally emanate a sense of strength through their cut, but an ill-fitting suit undermines this message. In other words, it doesn\u2019t matter how well you may have nailed the power suit \u201cformula\u201d if your clothing doesn\u2019t fit well.Related ReadingHow Everything Should FitThe power suit is not defined by a particular color, but it must not venture beyond traditional, conservative colors. The power suit is not intended to convey individuality, creativity or fun and this sense of familiarity and tradition helps frame and compliment, rather than distract from, the wearer.Classic Power Suit OptionsPrevious ProductNext ProductHe Spoke StyleRoyal Blue Twill Suit$795He Spoke StyleNavy Chalk Stripe Flannel Suit$895He Spoke StyleClassic Navy Blue Worsted Suit$795He Spoke StyleGray Chalk Stripe Double Breasted Flannel Suit$995He Spoke StyleDark Blue Herringbone Suit$895Solid, not overly intricate patterns are typically worn with the suit, shirt, tie and socks, but simple, traditional patternssuch as the pinstripe suitor striped tie are power suit staples.How Can A Gray Suit Be A Power Suit?Shop This LookPrevious ProductNext ProductHe Spoke StyleMedium Gray Twill Suit$795BB#3 Repp Tie (Black)Brooks BrothersHe Spoke StyleWhite Poplin Dress Shirt$250Dean Oxford Dress Shoes in BlackBeckett SimononMichael AndrewsWhite Poplin Pocket Square$39Bright red is the established power tie colorbecause of what we associate with the color either consciously or unconsciously. It grabs attention, like red lipstick. Matadors in red are incredibly masculine. In nature, the color often communicates danger. Humans use it for stop signs and red lights.If navy blue is the color of professional power, gray is the color of power under control.So what do we associate with the color gray? The answer tells us why the gray power suit makes so much sense. Instead of the kind of power that is attention-seeking, bold and aggressive, gray reminds us of different facets of power. Here are three:Related ReadingThe Science Of Style: How To Use Color To Influence PeopleWe first think of gray being associated with more advanced age, wisdom and trust. It\u2019s neutral, which can help establish an air of fairness and objectivity that may be extremely powerful in certain settings.Grays are often associated with sleekness or modernity,like the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao.Finally, gray has an industrial, concrete sense that conveys gravity and longevity.It\u2019s easy to think of professional moments where one might want to convey wisdom, professionalism, sleekness or gravitas. These are different sides of the power coin to the red discussed above and, in a more nuanced sense, the traditional navy blue power suit.The navy blue power suit is great and I won\u2019t try to talk you about of it as navy blue brings elements of tradition (military uniforms) and trust (as the expected choice). Two powerful elements to project. If navy blue is the color of professional power, gray is the color of power under control.The HSS Medium Gray Twill SuitHe Spoke StyleMedium Gray Twill Suit$795What\u2019s my go-to gray power suit? Our very own medium gray twill suit, of course. Featuring a rich twilled wool from the venerable Vitale Barberis Canonico who has been creating quality fabrics in Italy for more than 350 years, it\u2019s a versatile staple of my wardrobe.You can customize the styling many different ways to suit \u2014 sorry, not sorry, for the pun \u2014 your own tastes, but I personally prefer the classic two button, double vented jacket with a notch lapel and flap pockets. The double venting adds a bit more modernity than the single vent, very much in line with out motto of \u201cclassic style, modern sensibility,\u201d while the notch lapel maintains the more conservative focus.For trousers, I like side adjusters with a single reverse pleat and two-inch cuff, but again these can all be made to your preferences and specifications when ordering from the HSS Shop.How I Styled ItOne of the great things about gray is how easily it pairs with so many colors. A light gray suit looks great with a light pink or pastel green shirt, but those combinations are for different occasions.For the power suit styling, I paired my medium gray twill suit with a classic white shirt, black tie with white stripes and simple white pocket square for that all-important sliver of contrast. It\u2019s a look that\u2019s pulled together without being loud or commanding attention. This classic combination belongs in any decade as it would have looked just as good in the Mad Men era of Madison Avenue as it does today in Midtown. I feel confident wearing it and it really suits my style as it projects confidence in a refined and subtle way.Of course you will want any accessories to complement the outfit rather than stand out and make their own statements. My classic Datejust along with a pair of wholecut Oxfords fit the bill perfectly.The Bottom LineWe need not think of gray suits as forgettable, drab, or boring. Instead, when worn with confidence as part of a well-considered wardrobe in the right setting, it can convey subtle, nuanced power in a way you may not have thought possible.The gray power suit need not replace the navy blue power suit. I do, however, hope that you will consider adding it to the rotation for the right occasions. After all, it\u2019s these slightest nuances and attention to detail that make men\u2019s style so fun and interesting.Thanks, as always, for reading.This Article is part of the Shop Drop Series.Previous ProductNext ProductWhy A Flannel Safari Jacket Is My New Fall FavoriteA Modern Classic: Why the Royal Blue Suit is a Game-ChangerPure Summer Elegance: The Cream Linen SuitCould This Be The Ultimate Menswear Power Move?A Suit That Is Definitely Not Boring: Terracotta HopsackThe Solaro Suit: Summer\u2019s Most Interesting & Unique FabricThe Perfect Spring & Summer Alternative To A Navy BlazerThe Perfect Sport Coat To Upgrade Your Spring And Summer Style5 Very Good Reasons To Own A Houndstooth Sport CoatWhy Long Coats Are Making A Serious ComebackA Very Solid Argument For Wearing A Black SuitHow To Wear A Serious Statement SuitIntroducing: The Black Basket Weave Sport CoatIntroducing: The Brown Double-Breasted Flannel SuitThe Absolute Best Way To Style A Burgundy SuitIntroducing: The Dark Brown Donegal Tweed SuitIntroducing: The Gray Herringbone Tweed Sport CoatIntroducing: The Brown Glen Plaid Flannel Sport CoatIntroducing: The Forest Green Flannel SuitIntroducing: The Navy Blue Flannel SuitStylishly Yours,Brian SacawaBrian Sacawa is the Founder of He Spoke Style and one of the original men\u2019s style influencers.

In fact, it\u2019s a pretty widely agreed upon stance across the menswear world. But why? Why is navy such a great choice for your first foray into the world of men\u2019s tailoring?If you ask me, it comes down to one simple priority \u2013versatility. When it comes to the foundations of your wardrobe, especially when you build from the ground up, versatility is key, and nothing is more versatile than a navy suit. Here\u2019s why.1. Wear it (pretty much) anywhere.First, think of dress codes \u2013 a navy suit hits almost all of them. Short ofblack tie, you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find an occasion where a navy suit is inappropriate.Business casualand evenbusiness formalare pretty flexible, but a navy suit satisfies the trickier dress codes just as well, fromcocktail attireto themore formal end of things.| BRIAN WEARS |Michael Andrews Bespoke suit and shirt,Seaward & Stearn x HSS tie, Garrett Leight sunglasses, Rolex watch, Carmina loafers| PHOTOGRAPHY |byRob McIver Photo2. Dress it up or dress it down.Which slides easily into the idea that a navy suit is just so easy to dress up or down to fit your needs. Think of the suit itself as a blank slate and swap out the other pieces accordingly. A navy suit over a t-shirt and clean white sneakers is a perfect summer casual look. A navy suit with a solid white shirt, repp-stripe tie and white pocket square is the ideal go-to, middle-ground outfit for a job interview. A navy suit over a patterned shirt with a bold, peppy tie and monkstrap shoes is an effortless way to flex those sprezzy muscles.3. Easy to match.Getting down to some technicalities, a navy suit also has the benefit of being incredibly easy to match with, colorwise. Brown shoes and brown belt \u2013 perfect. Black shoes and black belt? Just as good. A classic men\u2019s wardrobe tends to be dominated by blues, greys, and tans, all of which are a perfect complement to a navy foundation.4. A strong separate game.Finally, the versatility level just explodes when you consider the idea of suit separates. The one piece of menswear more timeless and classic than a navy suit might just be a navy blazer \u2013 get the right navy suit and you\u2019re set on both fronts. Rock the jacket with anything from ivory linen chinos to worn-in, light wash denim \u2013 and then try those suit trousers with a luxe knit polo or under a rustic tweed blazer. Think of the all the other men\u2019s staples, and you\u2019ll be hard pressed to think of any that won\u2019t work in some way with a navy suit. \u201cEndless opportunities\u201d is a term that gets thrown around a lot, but here it\u2019s really the only way to put it.At the end of the day, when you\u2019re just starting out in the world of respectable attire, you\u2019ve got to make sure that those initial purchases have that versatility necessary to form a foundation in your wardrobe. And there\u2019s no better way to do that than by starting with a navy suit.Thanks, as always, for reading.Stylishly Yours,Adam LehmanHe Spoke StyleAdam LehmanAll Posts00Join the Conversation",

Yet, there\u2019s absolutely no need to be afraid of pattern mixing. In fact, you probably do it more than you realize with accessories like socks, ties, scarves or outerwear.With a few simple guidelines, you can confidently add another dimension to your wardrobe as you pair items you previously considered standalone pieces due to their patterns. In this post, we\u2019ll discuss three \u201crules\u201d for pattern mixing as well as a few \u201cadvanced\u201d tips to help you level up even more. And, please, consider these guidelines rather than hard and fast rules.Rule No. 1: Choose Two Different Types of PatternsMost men\u2019s patterns fall into one of three categories: stripes, dots and checks. The first guideline is to mix two different pattern types within your outfit. Stripes with dots. Stripes with checks. Dots with checks.If wearing a window pane sport coat, for example, consider pairing it with a striped shirt. Two items from the same pattern category often compete, rather than compliment, each other. Again, this is a guideline more than a rule and combining similar patterns . Allowances here will largely depend on the types of pieces, types of patterns, materials, setting, colors, the rest of the ensemble, etc. If you go beyond pulling two patterned pieces together, the guideline still holds.Related ReadingThe 10 Most Stylish Movies Of All TimeA great example of this?American Gigolo.Here, Richard Gere looks perfect in this striped shirt and dotted tie. It takes his character\u2019s classic style to the next level.Rule No. 2: Vary Pattern Size & ScaleIt\u2019s typically best to pick one piece with a larger pattern size and another with a smaller pattern. This allows the patterns to complement rather than compete and gives an outfit more depth. The smaller pattern may only be noticeable upon closer inspection with the larger pattern easily seen from a distance.Photography by Rikesh Chauhan.Photography by Rikesh Chauhan.Consider this gentlemancaptured in our recent Pitti Uomo street style serieswhere the large checks of his jacket immediately capture the eye and it isn\u2019t until closer inspection that the striped shirt becomes apparent. I know we are talking patterns here, but he also does an excellent job of complimenting colors. It is a look that could go very wrong very quickly, but just works.Related ReadingPrevious ProductNext ProductThe Best Street Style From Pitti Uomo 105: Day 1The Best Street Style From Pitti Uomo 105: Day 2The Best Street Style From Pitti Uomo 105: Day 3The Best Street Style From Pitti Uomo 105: Day 4Rule No. 3: One Bold, One SubtleThis, once again, comes back to balance and finding pieces that compliment each other rather than compete. Wearing multiple patterns already increases the interest level of an outfit and wearing two bold patterns is likely going to be overwhelming. Larger patterns, although are often the boldest, aren\u2019t always. Consider color, contrast, and where they are featured in an outfit as well.Photography by Rikesh Chauhan.Another example here, also spotted in Pitti Uomo, is this gentleman\u2019s checked scarf. It actually is given space to stand out from the striped shirt and herringbone overcoat.Let\u2019s pause here to consider our three guidelines with this look from Lane Pryce in Mad Men.Lane actually wears stripes, checks and dots all in this one outfit so we\u2019ll give him credit for not double dipping in any single category. The checked pattern of his waistcoat is large, the dots on his tie medium-sized and the stripes on his jacket thinner. Finally, the tie pattern makes for a bold, stand-out piece while the pattern in the jacket is quite subtle. The waistcoat is somewhere in between. In a more subdued outfit, this pattern would stand out more, but within this outfit it plays a secondary visual role quite well.These three guidelines will serve you well and get you out of the house looking good while wearing multiple patterns. Those are the three things I recommend keeping in mind all of the time, but I also want to share a few tips that might be helpful from time to time.Tip No. 1: Fabric Can Add A Pattern-Like ElementCorduroy, knit ties, tweed and twill can add similar visual interest to an outfit, typically in a more understated way. Consider pairing a fabric with more depth with a patterned piece to see how they work together.I like how the bold, sharp, colorfully patterned tie worked with the softer, subtler tweed in this brown suit.Shop This LookPrevious ProductNext ProductHe Spoke StyleDark Brown Donegal Tweed Suit$895He Spoke StyleLight Blue Microstripe Oxford Cloth Button Down$275Woven Plaid NecktieGUSLESONClegg Split Toe Derbies in BrownBeckett SimononMichael AndrewsWhite Poplin Pocket Square$39Tip No. 2: Pattern Real Estate MattersIt\u2019s often a little easier to pull in an additional pattern when worn on a piece that doesn\u2019t dominate the silhouette. This could be accessories like ties, scarves, hats or socks, but it could also be a shirt or sweater underneath another layer. Either way, these pieces can allow solids to anchor the outfit. Think of it like adding playful throw pillows to a sofa vs. the sofa itself being loud.Take this double-breasted brown suit outfit I put together for a business setting, which might not be the first place you think of for wearing multiple patterns. It works because neither pattern dominates the outfit which keeps the overall look from becoming too casual or distracting.Shop This LookPrevious ProductNext ProductHe Spoke StyleBrown Double-Breasted Flannel Suit$895He Spoke StyleBengal Stripe Dress Shirt$275Michael AndrewsBrown with Blue Stripe Silk/Wool Necktie$165Clegg Split Toe Derbies in BrownBeckett SimononAnd, yes, I didn\u2019t follow my own guideline number one here, but the difference in scale of the two patterns, and checked detail in the fabric of the tie made me feel comfortable with it. Guidelines not rules!And, actually, here\u2019s a little tutorial on how to combine similar patterns.Tip No. 3: Pick A Color, Any ColorColors certainly do not need to be the same across patterns (difference in colors, in fact, was one reason I paired the two stripes above), but sometimes it can be helpful and provide a different type of opportunity.Consider the classic navy blue twill suitand complementing shades of blue across the shirt, tie and pocket square in this look. Complementary colors soften the look of different patterns and help to tie them together.Shop This LookPrevious ProductNext ProductHe Spoke StyleRoyal Blue Twill Suit$795He Spoke StyleNavy Check Tattersail Dress Shirt$175Michael AndrewsBlue with Tan Medallion Silk Necktie$165The Bottom LineIn conclusion, by engaging in some simple pattern mixing you may find new looks within your current wardrobe.

Perhaps it is a product of the 90s, but a full three-piece suit has steadily fallen from grace. And that\u2019s a crying shame.The truth is, the three-piece suit is a fantastically useful garment deserving of a place in the modern man\u2019s wardrobe.Can we resurrect it? I think so. Let\u2019s dig into our ultimate three-piece suit guide.What Goes Into a Three-Piece Suit?The discerning reader will note a \u2018three-piece suit\u2019 does indeed contain three parts: a jacket, a vest (or waistcoat, if you\u2019d like to call it), and a pair of trousers. Just as with any two-piece suit, all components should be of matching cloth and pattern. Windowpane suit + solid vest \u2260 a three-piece suit. That\u2019s just a suit with an odd vest. While that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, a three-piece suit it is not.Other than having all parts having the same cloth, you\u2019ve got flexibility on each piece.Jackets can be single or double-breasted, but personally I\u2019d go for single-breasted. A double-breasted model is already effectively a second layer of fabric, so a vest is a bit overkill. The coat can have peaked or notched lapels. While this is personal preference, I\u2019ll offer a few suggestions.First, consider the scale of formality. A more formal suit is perhaps best suited \u2014 ahem \u2014 to peaked lapels, while a standard notch works better, at least in my opinion, for most daywear situations.Second, the fabric.A charcoal flannel suitwould look excellent with full-bellied peak lapels and a double breasted waistcoat. The same might not be said forsand-shaded cotton.Third, and kind of hybrid of the first two, consider how often this will be worn as a full three-piece.The vest itself can be single or double-breasted. Traditionally, a single-breasted vest has six buttons, with the bottom one left unbuttoned for comfort when seated. Double-breasted vests usually, but not always, have six buttons as well. Vests traditionally paired with tuxedos can have a deep placket and only four buttons. Some of this look has made its way into modern business wear, and I\u2019m not sure how much I like it.Invest In A VestPrevious ProductNext ProductHe Spoke StyleDark Blue Herringbone Suit Vest$295He Spoke StyleBrown Donegal Tweed Vest$295He Spoke StyleLight Gray Flannel Suit Vest$295He Spoke StyleMid Navy Blue Flannel Narrow Chalk Stripe Vest$295While vests can have lapels (even peaked ones) themselves, I\u2019m less inclined to go for them. In my view, a lapel-less vest sits cleaner and better complements the outfit.Trousers, of course, function exactly the same as a two-piece suit. Flat front. Single or double pleat. Cuffs or no cuffs. It\u2019s up to you!Where Did Three-Piece Suits Come From?Good question. While it\u2019s difficult to nail down an exact time and place, October 7, 1666 is a good start. England had lopped the head off of a King in 1649 and lived under Parliamentary rule (and without Christmas) for about a decade, only to decide they wanted a King after all. That was the affable Charles Stuart, son of the previous King, who ascended the throne as Charles II in 1661.Portrait of Charles Edward Stuart (1720\u20131788) after E. Gill, c.1745\u20136.Image via.During theInterregnum,the young Charles had been exiled to France under the protection of the excellently-coifed and fabulously-dressed Louis XIV \u2014 The Sun King. However, the fops the French court decked out in doublet and hose just didn\u2019t suit him. Nor did it suit his subjects when he returned as King.But, the decision to adopt a new style literally overnight mightjust have been political. A series of unfortunate events \u2014 War in the Caribbean, a plague, and a Great Fire in London \u2014 made for a rocky start to the reign. On top of that, English Protestants were particularly distrustful of anything Catholic-and anything remotely French.Charles recognized this and sought to disassociate himself from the French Court and their ostentatious manner of dress. And so, as the diarist and MP Samuel Pepys wrote:Yesterday in Council the King declared his resolution to introduce a manner of dress which shall never go out of fashion. It will be a waistcoat, which, I don\u2019t know how, will teach the nobility a sense of economy, and that will do them good.Samuel PepysThis new \u2018manner of dress\u2019 was a longer vest made of black fabric, with a ruffled white shirt underneath. So,very briefly,how did we get from long vests to where we are today?The famous statue of George Bryan \u201cBeau\u201d Brummell, an arbiter of fashion in Regency England at the entrance of Piccadilly Arcade in Mayfair.The early 19th century period of the Regency,perhaps best embodied by legendary dandy Beau Brummel, frequently saw a shorter waistcoat of sorts with a longer jacket worn open. Trousers, instead of knee breeches and stockings, became fashionable-although the legs were worn inside of boots.Related ReadingHow Beau Brummell Invented Modern Men\u2019s StyleVictorian dress saw trousers fall outside the boots, and formal daywear with a vest became close to what today we\u2019d recognize as kind of white/black tie hybrid. The jacket was called a \u2018frock coat.\u2019 Vests could be either single or double-breasted; the latter being more formal, just as today. The Victorians also introduced a more casual \u2018lounge\u2019 suit. Made of a rougher fabric, it\u2019s pretty much what a full tweed suit looks like today.The Edwardian age saw the jackets for daywear get a little shorter and the bottom button on the vests left unbuttoned at Court (perhaps so as to not remind their liege lord of his ever-expanding waistline). Casual, lounge suiting may included a vest as well. \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d fans may recognize this vest as a component of shooting gear.The 1920s and 30s featured variations on the vest in both single and double-breasted models, but by the 1940s the vest had begun to fall out of favor. We\u2019ll cover that in a minute.Related ReadingThe Ultimate Guide to 1920s Men\u2019s FashionThe 1970s saw a brief, wondrous return of the three-piece suit as disco culture permeated the United States, but after a flash of brilliance the multi-colored light faded there too.The 80s did see some three-piece suits, particularly in professions like law and banking \u2014 as our narrator Mark keenly observed. But, by, the 1990s, the three-piece suit (and suits in general) began to fade.Why did it happen? And, can we get it back?Why Did Men Stop Wearing Three-Piece Suits?I\u2019ll paint with a broad brush here, but bear with me.First, raw materials, including textiles, became far more scarce in the early part of the 20th century. Two World Wars required wool, cotton, and silks for the collective effort. Many men marched to battle rather than the office and such extravagances couldn\u2019t be justified. When men returned home from the fight, many countries were still subject to rationing. Even with the slow creep toward normalcy, the preference for the three-piece suit of yesteryear didn\u2019t return.Second, a change in consumer behavior. The cost-conscious customer began to demand goods with expediency and volume rather than focus on quality and fit. Synthetic polyesters overtook natural materials. A suit that once took a month or more to make could be picked up at the local department store in an hour. At the risk of stating the obvious, it\u2019s more costly, labor-wise, to produce a three-piece suit than a two-piece, so manufacturers began to produce fewer.Jimi Hendrix performing live on stage in 1969.Image via.Third, while (literal)volumeshave been written on counterculture and casual dress, suffice it (for now) to say the population, as a whole, simply dresses far more casually than it did 50 or 60 years ago. The three-piece is suit is far from the only casualty.Fourth is what I\u2019ll argue is a less personal work environment in traditionally more sober industries. Take finance and banking, for example. Before the rise of the personal computer, finance was, by and large, an intimate human interaction. You\u2019d meet with a personal banker or financial advisor, usually in an office, and discuss your finances, develop a long-term investment strategy, retirement plan, etc. This required a serious outfit from both parties to discuss it.But, in recent decades, as the industry has shifted from the power suit to the Power Mac (for those who remember) and into the world of smartphones, chatbots, an AI-assisted investing, this world increasingly operates behind a screen. Trades are completed with the push of a button. It\u2019s faster than ever before. The high finance uniform is no longer coat and tie \u2014 it\u2019s an OCBD, khaki pants, and a puffer vest.What are the Benefits of a Three-Piece SuitReading this rather stark analysis might imply the three-piece suit has gone the way of the dodo. But, I don\u2019t think so. This not-so-humble garment still packs a heavy sartorial punch.First, it\u2019s still highly versatile garment. If you buy one in a fabric and color \u2014say, navy wool\u2014 the possibilities are limitless. There are few situations you\u2019d normally wear a two-piece suit where youcouldn\u2019twear a three-piece one. But, you don\u2019thaveto wear all three parts at once. Without the waistcoat, you\u2019ve got a perfectly good two-piece suit.Related ReadingPrevious ProductNext ProductFall Business: Brown Three-Piece Suit1 Piece/5 Ways: Brown Three-Piece SuitAdd the vest, though, and it\u2019s one more weapon in your style arsenal. Mix and match a patterned waistcoat and solid jacket for a slightly dandy look, if that\u2019s your vibe.Or, add some depth to an outfit pairing a solid vest and patterned coat.You can also wear the vest on its own.In the summer, it\u2019s a great substitute when it\u2019s just too hot for a jacket.In cooler or in-between temps, try a tweed or a flannel as a little \u2018something\u2019 different.In an office setting, it\u2019s supremely versatile. If, in the winter, the heat is cranked up, a sweater can get a little stifling. A vest offers a little more coverage. Speaking of coverage \u2014 if I worked in formal office, I\u2019d find it a little annoying to get up and put on a jacket to greet a client, only to take it off again.

But, here are a couple guidelines, in my opinion, on the best places to wear a three-piece suit.Formal events and gatherings are great, and weddings are probably the best use case. You wear the full getup during the ceremony then take the jacket off when you hit the dance floor.Related ReadingWhen Can You Wear a Three-Piece Suit?Or, if you\u2019d like to channel your inner Nick Charles and shake your martinis to waltz time, a pinstripe model in the back of a wood-paneled bar is absolutely the way to go.Professional jobs, law and legislative in particular, are also perfectly acceptable situations. As referenced earlier, a vest is a little more formal than just a shirt, especially if you\u2019ll be seated during a meeting in your office and don\u2019t want to rumple a jacket.In the same vein, if you\u2019re a trial attorney, you may consider wearing one in the courtroom. In my view, it shows a certain reverence and respect for the law, your client, and judge and/or jury.Ultimately, a three-piece suit shows you\u2019re confident and in control. However, it\u2019s not always appropriate.In this modern age, I\u2019d probably skip a three-piece suit on a first date. Unless the date is to, say, the opera.I would also avoid a three-piece suit in casual office settings. You may consider a waistcoat separate, but it\u2019s a more stylishly adventurous option.Our Favorite Three-Piece SuitsLet\u2019s take a look at just a few of our all-time favorite three-piece suits.The Grey Tweed Three-Piece SuitRelated ReadingThe Incredible Benefits Of \u201cBoring\u201d StyleIf you\u2019ve got a more urban, sophisticated style,grey tweed is a great place to start for a more interesting three-piece suit.Yes, you can wear the full ensemble to most any work environment.

A pinstripe suit, in my view, shouldn\u2019t be your first, second, or third suit. I\u2019ve found them in a little harder to break up into separates. But, if you enjoy sea bass and make sure your dry martinis are shaken to waltz time, this is how to do it.I particularly like two things about this suit. First, the color is dark enough to be rather formal, but not so dark you can\u2019t see the contrast in the stripe. And, speaking of the stripe, this is a great width to look for when doing a stripe-on-stripe look.The Bottom LineI think the formality of a three-piece is a sort of middle finger to those who have thrown in the towel and come to accept the steady decline of dress and appearance. If you\u2019re the person who walks down the street and wonders, perhaps a little too openly, why everyone is dressed like crap, a three-piece is exactly what you need.It is a point of pride for you.

And a black three piece suit is obviously no exception. The great thing about a three piece suit is that it doesn\u2019t always have to be the complete package. You can get a ton of mileage out of mixing it up and pairing pieces together or as separates with other items in your wardrobe. Though when you do put it all together there really is no more commanding look. Here are six examples of how a black three piece suit can look put together and taken apart.Stylishly Yours,He Spoke Style1. Three Piece \u2013 All BusinessNo look presents quite as powerful an image as a three piece suit. It\u2019s masculine, elegant, and definitely says that you mean business.While a black three piece suit already makes a bold statement, pairing it with similarly bold colored accessories, like a deep red or burgundy tie and pocket square, makes it even more powerful.This look: Black three piece suit by Stile Benetton, White slim fitfrench cuff shirtby Brooks Brothers, Burgundy pin dot tie and silk pocket square by The Tie Bar, Blackleather cap toe oxford shoesby Cole Haan, Black socks by Johnston & Murphy, Black and silvercuff linksby David Donahue, Blackleather beltby Perry Ellis,watchwith black leather band by Timex, Blackleather briefcaseby Coach.2. Jacket & Pants \u2013 Mr. BrownAbsolutely timeless and classic. A black two piece suit looks great on everyone. For formal events it\u2019s a no brainer. But anytime you want to make a statement, a well tailored black two piece will certainly get the job done.While you can definitely interpret it as a blank canvas that will accept many color combinations, I like to rock it in its most classic manifestation with a crisp white shirt and pocket square, and a black tie with a sliver tie bar.This look: Black jacket and pants by Stile Benetton, White slim fitfrench cuff shirtby Brooks Brothers, black skinny tie (Army issue), Silvertie barby The Tie Bar, Black leathercap toe oxford shoesby Cole Haan, black socks by Johnston & Murphy, blackleather beltby Perry Ellis, white linen pocket square (vintage),watchwith black leather band by Timex.3. Wasitcoat & Pants \u2013 Fine and DandyMy favorite piece in any three piece suit is always the waistcoat, or vest. A waistcoat adds extraordinary versatility to any suit and I would definitely recommend adding one whenever possible. A waistcoat is meant to fit closely to the body and can be fine tuned by the adjuster on the back of the garment. Worn without the jacket, it creates a wonderful, slim silhouette. As a result, it\u2019s important to make sure your shirt fit is on point.A pocket watch is a great addition to any look with a waistcoat, but especially when it is worn without the jacket. I am not a jewelry guy but there\u2019s nothing like adding a little flash to a look with a nice pocket watch chain.This look: Black waistcoat and pants by Stile Benetton, Pink stripedcotton oxford shirtby J.Crew, Gold and navy striped bow tie and white cotton pocket square with navy border by The Tie Bar, Blue patterned socks by Johnston & Murphy, Blackpenny loafersby Bass Weejuns, Silver pocket watch by Bellagio Bel Tempo, Silver T-bar pocket watch chain by Dueber Watch Co.4. Waistcoat Separate \u2013 Date NightThere is no better way to dress up a casual look than by adding a waistcoat. It\u2019s a great upgrade to your look for a casual date night. And if it happens to be a first date, you are guaranteed to score major style points. When worn as a separate, treat your waistcoat like you would a blazer, being sure to finish off the look with a greatpocket square fold.Bonus Tip: Always leave the bottom button of your waistcoat unbuttoned. It\u2019s an old menswear detail and tradition that is worthy of preserving.This look: Black waistcoat by Stile Benetton, Darkdenim jeansandchambray shirtby J.Crew, Ecru plaid tie and brown pocket square by The Tie Bar, Brownsuede penny loafersby To Boot New York, Brown socks by Johnston & Murphy, Brownleather plaque beltby J.Crew,watchwith brown leather strap by Timex.5. Jacket Separate \u2013 Art OpeningIt can be difficult to wear a black suit jacket as a separate. It is a fairly formal-looking garment and, depending on the fabric, can be a challenge to match with different pants even if you are a fabric or pattern mixing pro. Taking a playful approach can often lead to great results.A pair of plum or burgundy pants are a great investment. They are subtle enough to not call attention to themselves, but definitely an interesting departure from a black on black ensemble. A fun pocket square can really tie a look like this together. Here it compliments the burgundy pants and provides an extra bit of pop.This look: Black suit jacket by Stile Benetton, Burgundypantsby Express, Blackv-neck t-shirtby American Apparel, Plum and gold paisley pocket square by The Tie Bar, Blackleather beltby Perry Ellis, Grey socks by Johnston and Murphy, Blackpenny loafersby Bass Weejuns.6. Pants Separate \u2013 Casual FridayI know what you are thinking: black pants and brown shoes? There\u2019s a rule against that, right? Traditionally, yes, black pants, black shoes. Period. But what good are rules if they\u2019re not broken every once in a while? Brown shoescanwork with black pants if you do it right.The key is to pair other brown garments with the black pants.

I\u2019ll talk about this in more detail later in the post but suffice to say, it checks off that big versatility box on my \u201cshould I add this to my wardrobe\u201d list. And here are five ways I\u2019m wearing it.1. Formal LeaningsShop This LookPrevious ProductNext ProductHe Spoke StyleBrown Double-Breasted Flannel Suit$895He Spoke StyleWhite Poplin Dress Shirt$250Black Grenadine TieCharvetDean Oxford Dress Shoes in BlackBeckett SimononMichael AndrewsWhite Poplin Pocket Square$39While I wouldn\u2019t necessarily consider a brown double-breasted flannel suit a garment tailor made for formal events \u2014 I\u2019d generally choose anavy blue chalk stripeorcharcoal gray double-breasted chalk stripe\u2014 it can certainly be dressed up for more formal occasions.In those situations, I will always go with a simple, tried and true, no-brainer solution: white poplin dress shirt, black grenadine tie, white pocket square, and black Oxfords. It\u2019s a combination that just works and lets you think of the suit as the main attraction. And, yes, you can wear a black tie and shoes with a brown suit if it is done with intention.However, as you can see from this set of photos, which were taken in the late morning, there is a bit more contrast between the brown and black that you may be comfortable with. I get that. And it\u2019s why I think you must be selective about the occasions you\u2019d wear this outfit to. Because this look feels quite elegant, I would reserve it for evening events of the cocktail party variety or perhaps a date at a dimly-lit restaurant. Much easier to photograph in natural light though . . .2. Relaxed & ChicIt\u2019s very easy to pigeonhole a double-breasted suit as a garment that can only be worn more formally and buttoned up. I understand the reasoning behind that thinking, however, relegating it to that category denies it the opportunity to shine as go-to attire for chic and relaxed outfits.Shop This LookPrevious ProductNext ProductHe Spoke StyleBrown Double-Breasted Flannel Suit$895Merino Turtleneck SweaterCharles TyrwhittSydney Leather Penny LoafersCrockett & JonesI will say that if you are unaccustomed to wearing a double-breasted suit unbuttoned and without a tie, you may find it a bit strange at first. There\u2019s a bunch of extra fabric and you\u2019re going to be like, \u201cwhat do I do with all this?\u201d Should you just let it hang? Should you try and sweep it behind you? There is definitely a \u201cway\u201d to pull of this look \u2014 a hand in pocket casually brushing one of the panels back is nice \u2014 but it really all starts with confidence. If you go into the whole scenario doubting yourself, it\u2019s not going to work. So if you\u2019re going to do it, own it.I will not wear all of my double-breasted suits in this manner, but a brown flannel double-breasted suit is, in my opinion, the perfect suit to do it with. It feels more casual. It has a warm and luxe vibe. Throw on a tan cashmere turtleneck and pair of loafers and you\u2019ve got a look that oozes style and sophistication.3.

This is how to wear a double-breasted suit, right? Well, it\u2019s one way and it\u2019s definitely an easy way! One of the reasons I love a brown double-breasted flannel suit is the interplay between formal and casual. The style of the suit is formal but the color and fabric is more casual. It\u2019s a fun bit of interplay that you can use to your advantage when putting an outfit together.When wearing this suit in a business setting, I do like to lean into the casual side of things just a bit. A bengal stripe shirt is not a casual shirt but with the addition of a grenadine striped tie, we\u2019re tempering the formality a bit and also engaging in some easy pattern matching \u2014 similar patterns, varying scales.You\u2019ll also notice my shoe choice leans more casual as well. Instead of Oxfords, I\u2019ve gone with a pair of split toe derbies.4.

While I\u2019ve neglected to style the jacket as a separate in this post, it is certainly possible to wear a double-breasted jacket as a separate. Try it \u2014 unbuttoned, of course \u2014 with a cream-colored brushed cotton shirt, light wash jeans, and some penny loafers and you\u2019ve got a wonderful casually tailored outfit. But I digress, because here, we\u2019re talking about the fact that with a flannel suit you also always end up with a great pair of fall and winter trousers.Speaking of casually tailored, I find that brown really enables that style of dressing due to the fact that it is warm, earthy, and generally seen as more casual (see: next outfit for more context). It has a way of appearing much less stuffy and buttoned up than blues and grays. Imagine this outfit with a navy blue Glen plaid jacket, light blue OCBD, and medium gray trousers, and you have to agree that it\u2019s certainly more business casual than casually tailored.Related ReadingA Simple Formula For Dressing WellIn addition to being soft (brushed cotton shirt and flannel jacket) and tonal (all shades of brown), this look is a nice illustration of how to put a good outfit together. One of the goals of wearing tailored clothing is to guide your eyes upward and frame your face. You can see that here. The darker trousers and shoes serve as an anchor. The patterned jacket provides some slight visual interest and a tonal transition to the cream-colored shirt, which frames my face.5.

As someone who wears a lot of brown, especially in suit form, I\u2019ve discovered there are more than a few men\u2019s style rule-toting extremists out there who seem to be quite willing to fall on their swords over this one. Seriously, though, passion is one thing, but this is clothing, people.For those unfamiliar with this superannuated sartorial statute, it came into being as brown was considered a color to be worn in the country on the weekend. During the week, when men worked in the city, they wore black, blue, or gray \u2014 in the darkest tones available, of course. Because of the business dress code of the time, brown was seen as more casual and off-duty, and \u201cno brown in town\u201d became perhaps something of a snide remark \u2014 or reminder \u2014 spoken by menswear mean girls to those who dared stray from tones stark and severe.Now that you know where it came from, the next (and honestlyonly) thing you need to know about the no brown in town \u201crule\u201d is that it is completely out of date. As long as you are dressing appropriately for business \u2014 in town or elsewhere \u2014 it no longer matters if you limit yourself to black, blue, or gray. And a dark brown double-breasted flannel suit is certainly dressed up enough for any traditional or classic business situation, even with a brown tie and brown shoes.The Bottom LineA brown double-breasted flannel suit is far from being a one-trick wonder. There are myriad ways to style it while always retaining its chic sophistication.This Article is part of the 1 Piece, 5 Ways Series.Previous ProductNext ProductI Found The Perfect Navy Blazer Alternative1 Piece, 5 Ways: Black Flannel Suit1 Piece, 5 Ways: Dark Brown Donegal Tweed Suit1 Piece, 5 Ways: Gray Herringbone Tweed Sport Coat1 Piece, 5 Ways: Brown Glen Plaid Flannel Sport Coat1 Piece, 5 Ways: Forest Green Flannel Suit1 Piece, 5 Ways: Navy Blue Flannel SuitStylishly Yours,Brian SacawaBrian Sacawa is the Founder of He Spoke Style and one of the original men\u2019s style influencers.

The first is that you can pretty much wearanycolor tie with a blue suit. A blue suit is one of the most versatile and \u201cneutral\u201d garments in a man\u2019s closet. And therefore, your choice of tie color can make your suit look and feel pretty much any way you want.(N.B. For argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s assume by \u2018blue\u2019, we\u2019re talking about navy blue or amoderate royal blue color.)And the second answer is pretty much just as unsatisfying as the first: it depends.Because, of course, the tie you choose should complement the situation and occasion.

It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s classic and especially around this time of the year, it\u2019s very appropriate. Burgundy accents add an element of richness and warmth to a look and today I\u2019m showing you one way to dress down your grey suit with some luxe, seasonal touches.| WEARING |Knot Standardsuit and shirt,Seaward & Stearn x He Spoke Style scarf, Carl F. Bucherer watch,Rebus signet ring,Johnston & Murphy loafers| PHOTOGRAPHY |byRob McIver PhotoRemember that wearing a suit does not mean you have to wear a tie. In fact, ditching the tie is a simple way to dress down a suit. That\u2019s wherechoosing the right collar stylecomes in. A shirt collar should stand up underneath the jacket and abutton down collarnot only helps that but it also contributes to the overall casual, sans tie vibe.When you\u2019re accenting a solid suit with a color \u2013 in this case, burgundy \u2013 make sure those accents have a little pattern. De Niro did the solid on solid on solid thing inCasino, but it\u2019s not the 90s anymore and these days that kind of pairing just looks amateur. Don\u2019t be afraid to mix patterns either (here\u2019s a quick guide). A burgundy bengal stripe shirt pairs effortlessly with aburgundy silk scarf with a timeless dot pattern.Burgundy tassel loafers are a must. For a dressed down grey suit look, there\u2019s no better footwear. I\u2019ve been getting a lot of wear out ofthis pairfrom our friends at Johnston & Murphy. I\u2019ve always been impressed with the comfort of a J&M shoe right out of the box and these are no exception. And the fact that they\u2019re Goodyear welted only means they\u2019re going feel better on my feet the more I wear them.Thanks, as always, for reading and Happy New Year!Stylishly Yours,Brian SacawaHe Spoke StyleBrian SacawaBrian Sacawa is the Founder of He Spoke Style and one of the original men\u2019s style influencers.

Aren\u2019t black suits pretty standard? Shouldn\u2019t every guy\u2019s first suit be a black suit?\u201dRecord scratch sound effect.If you thought the latter, don\u2019t worry about it. Getting a black suit as a first suit is a common misconception among and mistakemadeby guys just starting out on their personal style journey. It\u2019s also one of the main reasons for framing this post the way the I have with the title.Rather than bore you here with the myriad reasons you shouldn\u2019t get a black suit as your first suit,I recommend checking out this post at your leisure, but what it really boils down to is versatility \u2014 you can do a whole lot more with a navy suit or a gray suit than you can with a black suit.Related ReadingWhy Your First Suit Should Be A Navy SuitJust so you know, I am speaking completely from personal experience here. In fact, one of the very first posts in our popular \u201c1 Piece, Many Ways\u201d series on the site from back in 2013, featured a black suit.It\u2019s true!(And, yes, I am wearing my old Army issue Class A tie in Look No. 2.) I was just beginning my own style journey and like many men before me, I thought a black suit was the way to go.But then a funny thing happens when you start to learn more about classic menswear and gain a more thorough understanding of its principles. Once you begin to value the concept of versatility and the versatility a navy or gray suit provides you, a black suit takes on a much different character in your mind. Suddenly, it\u2019s the last thing you ever want to admit owning or wearing, like those Skidz you wore once or twice in middle school because they were the must-have thing for Christmas. And by \u201cyou,\u201d I mean me . . .Some favorite piecesPrevious ProductNext ProductHe Spoke StyleBlack Flannel Suit$795He Spoke StyleBlack Basket Weave Sport Coat$695He Spoke StyleBlack Rustic Tropical Wool Suit$795For years \u2014 the better part of a decade, actually \u2014 the only black \u201csuit\u201d you\u2019d ever catch me in was a tuxedo. I needed to show the menswear world that I \u201cgot it,\u201d dammit! But recently, I\u2019ve had a pretty significant change of heart towards the black suit (as well as other black tailored garments). I believe there is a place in every man\u2019s wardrobe for one. In fact, I\u2019ll even go so far as to say that every guyshouldown a black suit.I know that\u2019s a pretty bold statement. And it does come with a few qualifications. So, in this post we\u2019ll discuss some reasons to own a black suit, when to wear a black, whennotto wear a black suit, and take a closer look at the He Spoke Style shop\u2019s newest addition \u2014 our black flannel suit.The Best Reasons To Own A Black SuitLet\u2019s face it, if you\u2019re at the point in your style journey that you\u2019ve completely written off the black suit, you may need some convincing reasons for why you should own one. Well, as I would now consider myself an \u201celder\u201d in the menswear world, hopefully you\u2019ll listen to the two best reasons I can think of.Shop This LookPrevious ProductNext ProductHe Spoke StyleBlack Flannel Suit$795Italian Wool Flannel Tie In CharcoalTodd SnyderHe Spoke StyleWhite Poplin Dress Shirt$250Dean Oxford Dress Shoes in BlackBeckett SimononMichael AndrewsWhite Poplin Pocket Square$39The first reason is that a black suit will provide a certain amount of depth and versatility to your wardrobe. If you\u2019ve built up a closet full of classics \u2014 navy and gray suits, jackets, and sport coats, maybe some pattern peppered in \u2014 it\u2019s time to take a step back and assess the situation. While a black suit should definitely not be your first suit, sometimes it is the most perfect option for a specific occasion. More on that below.The second reason to own a black suit is that you will most certainly stand out. A perfectly timed well-fitted black suit outfit can make a huge impact and have quite a wow-factor. I recently attended an event in NYC where I knew there\u2019d be a lot of menswear folks dressed the way menswear folks do for events such as that.So, wanting to make a bit of a statement, I wore our black flannel suit with a charcoal tie \u2014 the exact outfit you see in this post. I\u2019ll tell you what, I received the most compliments I\u2019ve ever heard for this particular suit. Why? It fit great. It looked polished and sophisticated. And it really stood out against the blues, grays, and browns of everyone else.When To Wear A Black SuitYou will have gleaned from the reasons given above that there is a time and place for a wearing a black suit. If it\u2019s not an everyday suit, then when should you wear it? Here are my four suggestions.Winter.Although some may like to counter winter\u2019s bleakness with pops of color and whatnot, I for one like to lean into it. Black has been one of my go-to \u201ccolors\u201d this winter and it\u2019s one of the best reasons to own a black suit in a flannel fabric.Evening.This may seem ridiculously obvious, but a black suit is best suited \u2014 sorry not sorry, for the pun \u2014 for evening wear. It\u2019s one of the most chic and sophisticated options for a cocktail party, cocktail or dinner date, or attending an orchestra or opera performance.Festive.While black isn\u2019t the most festive color, I definitely believe that a black suit is a great option for festive occasions. Again, it\u2019s sophisticated and it will stand out. And it also provides a great opportunity to have fun with some subtle (but not) festive highlights. Throw on a pair of bright red or red tartan socks and you\u2019ll be the star of the show.Funeral.While this is an event that nobody ever wants to attend, showing up dressed well is a powerful way to pay (and show) one\u2019s respect.When Not To Wear A Black SuitI\u2019m going to keep this one short and sweet. The one situation you should never wear a black suit is for business. A black suit is not a business suit. It looks immature. It looks cheap. And it\u2019s much too high contrast for an office where one is required (or encouraged) to wear a suit.The He Spoke Style Black Flannel SuitI\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that our black flannel suit has been my absolute favorite suit this winter. It\u2019s the suit I wore the most in December and it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s going to get a lot of wear time next week when I\u2019m in Florence for Pitti Uomo. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the details.Aside from fit, one of the things that can really distinguish and set a suit apart is the fabric that it\u2019s made with. Ours is cut fromDragoSwing. It\u2019s quite soft, yet hefty, and wears exceptionally well. It\u2019s one of the nicest flannels I\u2019ve felt.The jacket. Once again, I\u2019ve chosen to style the suit jacket in a very classic and conservative manner. Two button, notch lapel, double vent, flap pockets, tone on tone lining, and fully canvassed. You will also notice that this jacket includes a hand done Milanese button hole, which is an option I highly recommend adding via our \u201csartorial upgrade.\u201dLike the jacket, I\u2019ve styled the trousers as I generally would with one exception. Side adjusters instead of belt loops and a two-inch cuff, as all flannel trousers should have. The exception I mentioned is that I decided not go with with my regular single reverse pleat in favor of a flat front.

Hence it is recommended to watch it and read the article to get a complete understanding of what to wear and when.Today, dress codes are still very much in existence, but the meaning has changed dramatically over the last 100 years. Just ask 10 people what a \u201cformal\u201d dress code requires, and you will likely get 10 answers, all of which are very different from even 30 years ago. Misunderstanding the dress code will inevitably lead to under- or overdressing, making yourself and others around you uncomfortable \u2014 or worse, it makes you look incompetent. In this particular guide, we\u2019re going to discuss dress codes in detail in an effort to give you a better understanding of what each dress code term means and how to appropriately adopt it. No matter what the invitation requests, you will know what it means and hence be able to look your best.Dress code on an invitationDress codes have been around for centuries, dating as far back as the Middles Ages, and they have been used to display class, socio-economic status or any other affiliation you can think of. Regardless of who you are or where you come from, dress codes are something most of us have had to contend with at some point in our lives. Whether it be an invitation to an event, a night out at the theater, or simply having to adhere to a dress code in our school days, there are times in each of our lives where we are asked or required to maintain a certain level of dress.Dress codes may seem unnecessarily restrictive in this day and age when many people (us included!) enjoy expressing ourselves through clothes and style.If you\u2019re skeptical about the need for a dress code, there is appropriate dress for every occasion, whether we want to admit it or not. You wouldn\u2019t wear a tuxedo to a construction site, and you certainly would never wear a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt to the opera. The two situations come across as pompous and disrespectful, respectively, and the goal of dressing appropriately is to respectfully enjoy the event or the company of your hosts without stealing the spotlight. Over or underdressing may cause you to forgo any future invitation that may otherwise come your way. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to check your personal style at the door when there is a dress code.So How Should I Dress?This is a broad question that\u2019s not easily answered. Asmart casualoutfit during November in Alaska is certainly different than one in Ecuador. And an invitation that asks forUrban Chicis not quite as clear as Black Tie. What do you wear if no indication is given on the invitation? Follow these steps to make a sound judgment about what to wear.Black Tie Dress Code1. Inspect the InvitationIf the invitation is engraved, letter-pressed, or embossed on nice card stock, the host is probably spending time and money on the event. Acknowledge the efforts with a suit, dress shirt and neckwear \u2014 women should wear at least a cocktail dress. Store-bought cards are trickier to decipher because they vary from extravagant to basic, so search for other possible tip-offs (see below). When dealing with Evites (which are even sent for weddings these days), look for hints in the design and the wording. If a dress code is declared, it is typically found at the bottom or on the lower-right hand corner of the invitation or reception card.2. Ask the HostIf the invitation doesn\u2019t mention a dress code, ask the host. In case that is not an option, you\u2019re going to have to play detective. Find out what the purpose of the event is, where it is, and whether you know other people who have attended the event before or who know the hosts and their style or preference.3. Be Mindful of the ThemeIf this is an annual event for a charity or an organization, check out what has been photographed and documented online to guesstimate your getup. Religious ceremonies, like Bar Mitzvahs and baptisms, deserve respect with proper attire.Dinner Jacket in dark blue with shawl collar4. Note the TimeAs a general rule, parties after 5 p.m. mean more elegant looks, whereas daytime functions tend to be low-key.5. Scope Out the LocationApartytaking place at someone\u2019s house will probably be more relaxed than one at a venue. But if it\u2019s at a catering hall or a restaurant, browse the website to gauge its vibe. Outdoor shindigs tend to be less formal than indoor functions. Country-club protocol, however, leans toward jackets and not jeans.Dress Codes DecipheredIn case your invitation states a dress code, things should be more straight-forward.Formal WearAlthough this term is often used to refer to all kinds of horrible outfits at tuxedo rental stores, formal wear refers to black tie, white tie,morning dress, or the stroller suit. Of course, they come with a variety of other terms which mean the same thing, but here is our breakdown for formal wear and what to dress in.Evening Wear / Formal Evening WearAs the name implies,evening wearshould be worn in the evening, and for men, that means White Tie or more often Black Tie.Ted, John, and Robert Kennedy in White Tie attend the annual Gridiron Club dinner in Washington, D.C., on March 15, 1958White TieWhite Tieis the most formal version of evening wear and consists of the following attire:A black tailcoat with matching trousers that feature a single stripe of satin, Grosgrain or braid in the United States or two thin stripes in Europe.A white piqu\u00e9 or Marcella vest and a shirt with Marcella bib or starched shirt front, single starched cuffs, shirt studs and detachable wing-collar.Braces are used to ensure a good fit and white (not black or dark) formal shirt studs and cuff links are used to complete the look.Awhite Marcella bow tieis worn with white,unlined leather glovesand black patent leather opera pumps or cap-less oxfords withevening shoelacesandblack over the calf silk dress socks.Awhite linen pocket squareand aboutonnierepolish off this ensemble.

To maintain an elegant look, pair the standard black tuxedo with trendy or whimsical items such as a patterned bow tie, a softly colored shirt, playful cufflinks, or a bold boutonniere.

To stay on the elegant side of this dress code, mirror cocktail attire with a holiday themed touch, such as atie,bow tieorpocket squarein holiday colors, or add an element of tartan or plaid.

There are certainly some overlaps and rules that are difficult to keep straight, and the semi-formal one certainly is one of these, and we\u2019ll define what it is in this guide.Table of ContentsExpandCollapseHistory of the Semi-Formal Dress CodeWhy Semi-Formal Is Such a Confusing Dress Code\u200b\u200bWhat Semi-Formal Wear Means TodayThe Essential Components of a Semi-Formal OutfitWhat Semi-Formal is NotExamples of Semi-Formal AttireQuick Tips for Mastering Semi-FormalConclusionOutfit RundownThe semi-formal dress code is also referred to as \u201cHalf Dress\u201d because in Latin, \u201csemi\u201d means half. Semi-formal falls just belowBlack Tie Optionaland above Cocktail Attire on the formality scale. And unlike other types of dress codes, which are more easily defined by the garments that go with them, semi-formal can actually be a little bit more difficult to define versus other more concrete dress codes.The Dress Code PrimerLEARN MORE HEREThis is the same dress code that has the same dignity and formality as higher levels of dress but with a little bit more of the laxity of lower levels of dress. Basically, it\u2019s like business attire and cocktail attire with a more formal error, and it\u2019s without the strict rules of evening wear. So what caused semi-formal to have this sort of amorphous lack of style standards? Let\u2019s examine its history in order to find out further.History of the Semi-Formal Dress CodeWhen rules of classic style were being formulated in the early 19th century, the higher levels of dress were very clearly fleshed out, and the standards of formal attire were also very strict. On formal day occasions, one was expected to wearmorning wear, and an informal evening occasions, White Tie.The standards of formal attire were very strict in the early 19th century.During the close of that century, a new level of formality came out, which was designed for exclusivity and high-end but also with a more casual nature of a private event. But since it was still relatively formal it was called semi-formal attire. This consisted of a stroller or really well-put-together suits during the daytime andBlack Tieduring the evening.At one point in time, tuxedos were seen as casual. Men\u2019s style manuals from the 1890s made it very clear that when we look back in history, oftentimes, a dinner jacket or odd formal jacket was too informal or casual for evening events.1896 handbook \u201cThe Complete Bachelor Manners For Men\u201d about dinner jacket.According to the 1896 handbook The Complete Bachelor: Manners For Men, the dinner coat is the badge of informality. It is in vogue during the summer at hotel hops, small informalparties, to the play, at bowling parties, restaurant dinners, and in fact, any occasion not formal. And as men began to abandon White Tie, we will see that men started to wear tuxedos for all of their evening events.In the 1922 edition of Emily Post\u2019s Etiquette Guide, she notes that the tuxedo is worn every evening and nearly everywhere, whereas the tailcoat is necessarily only balls, formal dinners, and in a box at the Opera. So Black Tie, which used to be considered semi-formal, moved its way up the formality scale.1922 edition of Emily Post\u2019s Etiquette Guide on tuxedo.The semi-formal category was able to drop down the formality scale. It now sits in sort of an interesting space. It\u2019s now in the space that occupies Business Formal andBlack Tie Optional. And there\u2019s a surprising degree of overlap between the two. Although it can potentially be more formal than the former and less formal than the latter, both the history and the practical function of this dress code is what makes it so confusing.Why Semi-Formal Is Such a Confusing Dress CodeSo as dress codes are becoming less strict and less defined and, in many ways, are actually dying, it becomes more confusing as to what formal actually means. While classic style devotees recognize formal as being Morning Wear,White Tie, or Black Tie, for the masses, formal can mean just wearing a suit. And this is because every other aspect of their wardrobe is so casual.For most people, formal means just wearing a suit.Therefore, if semi-formal is more attached to formal and everybody has their own definition of formal, then results can vary wildly. In the end, semi-formal can really take up any space between formal andcasual wear. Also, some people take the meaning of semi as more casual, and you can assume that semi-formal means more formal casual attire. This is comparable tosmart casual. Finally, you could think that semi-formal means half formal, half casual.So, suffice it to say having undergone a massive sartorial shift after the elevation of Black Tie from semi-formal to formal and its somewhat confusing language, it\u2019s no surprise that the semi-formal dress code is so hard to nail down nowadays. Despite all of this confusion, modern society has been able to somewhat define and nail down what semi-formal attire means today.Preston Jack Raphael Eb at Bar in Black Tie\u200b\u200bWhat Semi-Formal Wear Means TodayAlthough this definition is a little rough around the edges and it can also be taken with extreme subjectivity. In its broadest sense, semi-formal can mean dressing up in a meaningful way. This can mean with some type of suit without straying into the world of formal wear. Obviously, this covers a wide swath of territory. This can cover a more formal end-of-business casual all the way up to a really nice business suit and not wearing a tuxedo.Within the realm of classic style, this definition is a lot more precise. This would consist of a dark suit, awhite shirt, leather dress shoes, tasteful neckwear, and elegant, unobtrusive accessories. But the fact of the matter is, this definition can often be too formal for a lot of today\u2019s semi-formal gatherings.Within the realm of classic style, this dark suit outfit may be too formal for today\u2019s semi-formal gatherings.Fort BelvedereSilver Black Silk Basketweave Formal Wedding and Business Tieshop hereFort BelvederePocket Square with Monogram Initial Classic White Irish Linenshop hereThe Essential Components of a Semi-Formal OutfitA lot of today\u2019s semi-formal gatherings might have a more casual twist on a formal element. This can mean light and bright colored suits, combinations with sport coats and trousers and even more casual wear. It can also include the absence of neckwear.You are especially likely to encounter this relaxed part of semi-formal with events that have a more casual and celebratory nature. And it might also feature more bold and creative styling elements. We might call this look Festive Semi-formal. This is something that you might often see atweddingswhere guests are still expected to dress up but also have a little bit of fun and have creativity with their accessories and various pieces of their ensembles.Preston wearing a festive formality semi-formal dress code that leans towards springy pastel tones.Because the classic definition of semi-formal typically leans a little bit more traditional, you really have to take note of what the host says in their invitation regarding the dress code for their event. If the event seems to be more casual then feel free to pick out pieces that would go with a more casual wardrobe. You should, at the very least, stay to the more formal end of business casual. And in doing so, chances are you\u2019re going to be one of the best-dressed and most dressed-up people in the room.Even within classic style, the time of day will greatly impact the formality of semi-formal. In general, daytime events tend to be more casual and fun festive occasions lend themselves to brighter color palettes and more casual details. This allows brighter palettes, more fun and bold accessories, and more panache overall.

These should all be avoided. I mean, after all, this is semi-formal, not formal attire.The dinner jacket and morning coat look too formal.On the flip side, formal is still in the name. So avoid any garments that are explicitly casual such as short sleeve or collarless shirts like a polo shirt or Henley, non-dress pants, casual shoes like loafers or sneakers, jeans, bright-colored dress shirts, excessively bold or vibrant accessories and light-colored suits, although it might be okay to wear a light colored suit if you\u2019re in a warm weather festive activity.So as you can probably tell from the constant repetition here, the most common place where you will experience and be asked to wear semi-formal attire is at a wedding. But there are times when it could also appear in other social events like anniversaries, birthdays, retirement parties, and receptions. But it can also appear in professional events like networking events and after-hours social gatherings.Too casual and over-the-top outfits are not Semi-formal.Semi-formal can also appear at public events like charity raffles, commemorations, or grand openings of a new store. And White Tie at the Opera might have been the thing back in the day, but things have certainly changed since then.Examples of Semi-Formal AttireKyleSo in the first outfit, Kyle keeps things grounded with a double-breasted suit, dark shoes and a white shirt. However, he does have a pinstripe on his double-breasted suit, which provides a little bit of visual interest. And the peach tie adds a fun pop of color. This would be great for a daytime semi-formal event.Kyle wearing a double-breasted striped suit in navy.PrestonPreston follows Kyle, using neckwear to add a splash of color, although he\u2019s going for a much deeper and richer color of red.

He pairs a dark suit with a white shirt, a pair of black shoes, and a white pocket square. His tie is also dark in color, and you\u2019ll note that his pocket square also has a very simple fold. This look is perfect for more formal evening semi-formal events, but it might be a little bit too somber for a daytime occasion.These examples highlight that when you\u2019re dressing in this type of dress code, accessories really matter. Just changing up a few accessories can rapidly transition it from a daytime semi-formal to a nighttime semi-formal look.Raphael in a most formal semi-formal outfit.Fort BelvedereMadder Print Silk Tie in Blue with Red and Buff Patternbuy thisFort BelvederePocket Square with Monogram Initial Classic White Irish Linenbuy thisQuick Tips for Mastering Semi-FormalWhen in doubt, go more formal without being too formal. So unless you know that your host is expecting the more casual end of semi-formal, it\u2019s always best to go a little bit overdressed. Just make sure that you don\u2019t go too formal and drift into formal wear.Emphasize quality materials and patterns over flashy colors.Many online guides say that semi-formal attire is the place to throw out your latest bold look, but we disagree, especially at weddings. But this over-the-top flashiness is not something that we would recommend as a part of classic style, and it really doesn\u2019t jive with the overall formal look of semi-formal attire. Instead, go with luxurious materials and elegant patterns to really make your outfit look great. This way, you can craft ensembles that are easily memorable, and we mean memorable in a good way.Flashy colors in an outfit will look too crowded, and cry for attention.Make sure to wear a necktie,especially during daytime and nighttime events.

Even if it\u2019s an unspokendress code, it can often be required in traditional white-collar environments.Table of ContentsExpandCollapseThe History Of Business AttireWhat Is A Dark Business Suit?How To Stand Out Without Being Over The TopOutfit RundownIf you know the business attire dress code, you\u2019re always appropriately dressed for client meetings, network meetings, board meetings, or general office occasions. You can wear it if you have to attend thefuneralor if you are in court.The History Of Business AttireThe frock coat used to be the proper business attire [Image Credit:Wikipedia]Until a few decades ago, the only appropriate garment for the office used to be asuit, meaning a matching pair ofpantsandjacketout of the same fabric in a dark color. This was a solid, sometimes faint stripes, there was always a conservative suit with awhiteor lightbluedress shirt and some form ofneckwearsuch as a tie.Morning CoatAt the turn of the century, business attire was really only worn by the elite and the majority of the workers were blue-collar workers. In the very early days, a black frock coat was the proper business attire with black pants orcashmerestriped pants and white shirts and dark neckwear. Later on, themorning coatbecame more popular and then that was followed by thelounge suit.Popular work wear during the 20\u2019s-30\u2019s [Image Credit:Fumagalli 1891]1920\u2019s-1930\u2019sSuits, as we know them today, became more popular and the morning coat became outdated and was really only worn by very oldgentlemenwho were just stuck with their tradition. At that point in time, business suit fabrics were still quite heavy and offices were usually cooler which is why you would see many men wear awaistcoat, it just helped to keep them warmer.The rise of the suit [Image Credit:Mamas Latinas]Just like with any war, the conventions afterward were a lot more relaxed than before and that was also reflected in the office environment. So basically, that meant hats would slowly but surely disappear, the waistcoat would disappear, but you would still wear a dark suit, anecktiethat was somewhat conservative, as well asblackleather dress shoes.Notice the lapel width which is too wide [Image Credit:Pinterest]1950\u2019s \u2013 1980\u2019sThe styles changed, lapel widths changed, the width of the tie changed, but other than that, the basic core principles of dark suit, white or light blue shirt, conservative tie, and black leatherdress shoes, remained the same. Think of the saying\u201cNo brown in town\u201d,that indicated thatbrown shoeswere never appropriate for theoffice.Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko [Image Credit:The Wall Street Journal]In the 80s and 90s, the power suit became popular; you\u2019ve probably seen themovieWall Street with Michael Douglas pulling off that style. Even though the power suit fell out of favor, afterwards, the core of the dress code business attire still holds true today.Michael Douglas Dark Gray Peak-Lapel Suit in Wall Street [Image Credit:BAMF Style]In a nutshell, that means you wear a dark business suit, either a two-piece suit or a three-piece suit with a waistcoat. The shirt should be white or light blue or maybe a pastel color, it can be striped with a very small pattern, but overall, solids are preferable. You go with a conservative necktie either a dark red or dark blue, can be solid or a small pattern or stripes. You could either go with suspenders with a fishtail back or you can have a belt that matches the color of theshoesor you can just go without any of those two things and just have side adjusters on your trousers. It also means you haveover the calf dress socksthat don\u2019t expose your hairy legs in the office and optionally, you can have apocket square;it should have hand rolled edges and be folded in aTV fold. Now that\u2019s just a broad overview, let\u2019s dive a little deeper and define what all those things mean.What Is A Dark Business Suit?Navy suit with burgundy grenadine tieA gray flannel suit with matching waistcoatCharcoal brown is an acceptable colorIdeal ColorsIn terms of colors, that can be anything from navy to dark blue, charcoal, dark gray, medium gray, or light gray. The most classic form are just solid suits in one color, however, you can also have smaller micro patterns such as needle head or pinpoint.Pinpoint suit and repp tieThey have two colors when you look at them up close but from afar, it looks like a uniform solid color. You can also go with a more textured fabric such as sharkskin or a hopsack.If you want to go a little fancier, you can have a faint pinstripe or a chalk stripe, you can even go with a Prince of Wales check on a smaller scale and nothing with bold colored overplaidsin pink. Another option would be a faint windowpane but again, less is more and it is a conservative business suit so when in doubt, always scale it down a notch.Suit StylesBrown SuitNavy Blue SuitYou can have two-piece suits or three-piece suits. If you have a two-piecesuitthat is single breasted, I suggest you go with atwo-buttonjacket, you can also go with a three-row two or a simple single-breasted three-button jacket. Always opt for a notch lapel because that\u2019s more traditional. I\u2019d also opt for side vents, skip center vents because they\u2019re meant for horseback riding. The side vents are much better, you can put your hands in yourpocketand it doesn\u2019t expose your bum.Raphael in an office- and age-appropriate ensemble.Fort BelvedereTwo-Tone Knit Tie in Black and Magenta Pink Changeant Silkshop hereFort BelvederePurple Carnation Silk Boutonniere Buttonhole Flowershop hereFort BelvederePale Yellow Linen Pocket Square with Yellow Handrolled X Stitchshop hereIf you go with the double-breasted jackets, go with a six-button configuration where two are closed or maybe a four-button configuration where two are closed but avoid just a single row of buttons because that\u2019s too fashion-forward for a traditional business attire dress code.Inward facing pleats and side adjustersFor yourpantsor slacks or trousers, you can have a flat front, you can have apleated front.Personally, I\u2019m a big fan of inward pleats because it\u2019s more comfortable to sit in them. Yourpantscan have cuffs or no cuffs; if you go without cuffs, some consider it to be a little more formal. The advantage of cuffs or turn-ups is that they add a little more weight which makes your trousers hang and drape nicely.Even though combinations, let\u2019s say between ablazerand a pair ofchinos, are very acceptable in most offices today, it\u2019s technically not appropriate to wear a combination when a dress code requires business attire.Pronto Uomo White French Cuff Dress Shirt [Image Credit:Men\u2019s Warehouse]Dress ShirtsIn terms of dress shirts, ideally you want to opt for French cuffs forcufflinksand the majority should bewhiteand lightblue.AccessoriesMonkeys Fist Knot Cufflinks \u2013 925 Sterling Silver Platinum, Rose Gold and Yellow Gold Plated \u2013 Fort BelvedereFor cufflinks, avoid any kind of diamond cufflinks or colored stone or anything flashy. Stay with simple traditional gold and silver cufflinks; not combined but either/or. I suggest going withknot cufflinksbecause they\u2019ve been around for a long time, they\u2019re not flashy yet they work with everything in yourwardrobefrom yourtweedcoat to yourblack tieensemble.White linen pocket square with monogramWith a pocket square, thewhite pocket squareis a classic staple, you could also invest in some silkpocket squaresin subtle patterns and more muted colors that pick up tones of yourneckties.A necktie is probably the only way to introduce different colors into your outfit so traditionally, most business ties are either blue or some form of red or burgundy. If you want to branch out, you can go withgreen,yellow,purple, or other shades. Again, this is your chance to shine. The traditional material fortiesis silk, usually, they\u2019re either printed or it could striped like a repp stripe for example, or it can be just a jacquard weave in a classic muted pattern such as astripe in silver and blackwhich is the most formal, or you could have maybe a smallPrince of Wales checkwhich is very business appropriate.Shadow Stripe Ribbed Socks Dark Navy Blue & Royal Blue with Burgundy Derby Dress ShoeFor yoursocks, you traditionally want to match them with your pair of pants. You can also add a little bit of contrast by pairing the color of yoursocksto the color of your tie. In this day and age, that is acceptable.ShoesThe first shoe you should in invest in for business attire is the black cap toeoxfordwithout any form of broguing; that means no hole perforations. It\u2019s a classic staple, it always looks good. Once you have that, you can also invest in a quarterbrogueoxford that means there\u2019s just a little bit of perforation along the cap toe or you can have a half brogue where there\u2019s a little more perforation. You can also go with a full black oxford wingtip and in my opinion, it\u2019s a little too much and I prefer the quarter brogue and a half brogue but if you want to go for it, no problem. If you have more voluminous feet, you may want to go with aderbyshoe which is technically a little less formal but if it\u2019s in black color and has a nice leather sole, it\u2019s still perfectly acceptable.Hand burnished cap toe half brogue Oxford byAce MarksIn terms of construction, most classic business shoes are eitherGoodyear weltedor if they\u2019re from Italy, they can be Blake rapid stitched. In general, Goodyear welted soles are a little thicker, they\u2019re harder to break in but they also last for quite a long time.Italian shoesthat are blake rapid stitch typically have a thinner sole.While black is still the color of choice for business wear, you can also wear brown shoes. For dress code business attire, I would suggest you stick with darker shades of brown such as chocolate brown and you can also go with a dark oxblood color which can alternatively be worn with very casual outfits but also with business attire. Even though you can wear very light tan shoes in 95% of allofficestoday, I would stay clear of them if the dress code calls for business attire.How To Stand Out Without Being Over The TopNow as you can see, the dress code for business attire is rather strict and you may find it hard to stand out in a subtle sophisticated way. So in my experience, here are the good ways to stand out withbusiness attire in a professional mannerthat isn\u2019t garish or over-the-top.Faint stripe suit dotted tie and white linen pocket squareFort BelvedereSilk Tie in Jacquard Burgundy Red with White Polka Dotsshop hereFort BelvederePocket Square with Monogram Initial Classic White Irish Linenshop here1. Faint Striped Suits Over SolidsInstead of just a plain solid suit, you can choose to wear a suit with a faint stripe. It\u2019s different, its unique, it\u2019s appropriate for business attire. You can also add a matching waistcoat to make it more formal and more unique. Most business suits today are two-piece suits so adding that matching vest really elevates you from the crowd.2. Make Your Accessories CountMonkeys Fist Knot Cufflinks \u2013 Vermeil Sterling Silver Yellow Gold Plated \u2013 Fort BelvedereGo with cufflinks, maybe go with a slightly darker stone. Brighter colors such as yellow obviously pop more than a dark navy. Alternatively, you can also play with a texture rather than a plain silk tie, you can go with a grenadine tie because it has a wonderful texture. In any case, you want to avoid super bright pink ties or brightorangeties because that\u2019s garish and over-the-top. Instead, maybe opt for a dark purple maybe with a light Paisley on it or a bottle green tie with a micropattern.Knit Tie in Solid Prussian Blue Silk \u2013 Fort BelvedereMaybe you want to wear a pinstripe suit and add aknit tieto it. If you do that, go for a solid color that is maybe in the blue family because the texture itself is similar to grenadine but it\u2019s a little stronger and it\u2019s already some kind of a statement. Don\u2019t go overboard and have a two-tone knit tie with your business attire.Green Madder Silk Pocket Square with Turquoise,Orange and Yellow Large Paisley- Fort BelvedereYou could also choose a subtle pocket square. The white linen pocket square is great but having maybe a silk pocket square or a silk wool one with a paisley pattern that picks up the color of your tie is a great addition.Click here for a selection of BUSINESS ATTIRE appropriate accessoriesOxblood derby shoes withGrey Socks with Light Grey and Black Clocks in Cotton \u2013 Fort Belvederewith mustard yellow trousers3. Opt For Oxblood ShoesWhen it comes to shoes I think oxblood shoes are very underrated because they\u2019re very dark yet they have a really nice color depth. They work well with navy and gray suits and they\u2019re just slightly different without being as bright as let\u2019s say tan shoes. Adding a cordovan is a great way to stand out with business attire.Outfit RundownI\u2019m wearing a slightly more progressive business outfit. It\u2019s not the general solid dark business suit with a white shirt and a Glencheck tie instead, I opted for a plain striped suit. It\u2019s a three-piece suit, it\u2019s a relatively lightweight fabric. It has peak lapels, one button and it has a double-breasted waistcoat. My tie picks up those red tones. It\u2019s a burgundy tie with a very small polka dot which is very business appropriate. I keep the shirt white but I opted for a round club collar. I\u2019m going with French cuffs and I\u2019m wearing cufflinks in sterling silver and carnelian which pick up the red tones. And my socks pick up those red and white tones of my shirt and my accessories and they\u2019re a good barrier between my black half brogue dress shoes.Sven in a business outfit which he could wear in any office environment.Fort BelvedereEagle Claw Cufflinks with Carnelian Balls \u2013 925 Sterling Silver Platinum Platedshop hereFort BelvedereShadow Stripe Ribbed Socks Burgundy and light grey Fil d'Ecosse Cottonshop hereFort BelvedereSilk Tie in Jacquard Burgundy Red with White Polka Dotsshop hereFort BelvederePocket Square with Monogram Initial Classic White Irish Linenshop hereI also opted for a pinky ring and a white pocket square with the TV fold, a crown fold would have been too ostentatious.

But, for all of the fun that goes with looking at and wearing classic clothing, some of the conventions can be a real minefield to navigate. So, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the biggest menswear rules that you\u2019re likely to have heard of and the reasons why they\u2019ve come to be, and we\u2019ll show you how you can live a more fulfilling life by twisting, bending, or even breaking them.Table of ContentsExpandCollapseMenswear Style Rules to Break1.

These would include, but aren\u2019t limited to the practical application of clothing as wearing a hearty weatherprooftweedin the countryside does make more sense than a comparatively delicatebusiness suit, respecting the formality of a situation.Raphael wearing a weatherproof tweed jacket.Raphael wearing a brown business suit.Fort BelvedereDark Red Velvet Spray Rose Boutonniere Buttonhole Flower Fort BelvedereShop HereFort BelvedereWine Red, Yellow,Blue, Green, Orange Silk Wool Medallion Pocket Square \u2013 Fort BelvedereShop HereFort BelvedereShantung Striped Green, Purple and Cream Silk Tie \u2013 Fort BelvedereShop HereFort BelvedereSilk Pocket Square in Brown with Blue, Green, Red Large Paisley Pattern- Fort BelvedereShop HereAfter all, turning up to a prestigious club or formal dinner in a pair of sport shoes likespectatorswould be quite the faux pas, and the unfortunate fact that clothing rules would reinforce the hierarchy among social classes that existed until around the time of the First World War as those with more money could literally afford to pay more attention to sartorial rules.People also used to own far less clothing in the past and a lesser variety of clothing as well, so it was easier to set rules around clothing when there were fewer options available.1. Tie LengthWe\u2019re starting off with a bit of a big one: tie length. Anywhere you find someone wearing anecktie, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that there\u2019s going to be someone else close at hand to tell them that the specific length of their tie is incorrect.The standard \u201ccorrect\u201d length for a modern necktie: in the center of the trouser waistband.In general though, what\u2019s the issue here? Well, in a nutshell, according to menswear traditionalists, there\u2019s only one correct length for a necktie and that\u2019s squarely in the center of your waistband.The thing is though, there are a number of more nuanced variables that this highly simplistic rule just doesn\u2019t take into account. For example, let\u2019s say, for the sake of argument, that you\u2019ve only got one tie in your closet that you wear with multiple different outfits. Unless you\u2019ve got trousers that are all of exactly the same rise, which is fairly unlikely, then that one tie is going to be of a different length relative to the waistbands of all of these different pairs of pants.Raphael wears the same tie and pair of trousers here\u2013but that won\u2019t be easy to do all the time!Fort BelvedereMadder Silk Tie in Dark Ruby Red Macclesfield Neats Blue Orange Pattern \u2013 Fort BelvedereShop HereFort BelvedereNavy Blue Gray Suede Unlined Leather Mens Gloves with Button by Fort BelvedereShop HereFort BelvedereBurgundy Red Suede Unlined Leather Mens Gloves with Button by Fort BelvedereShop HereFort BelvedereIvory Silk-Wool Pocket Square with Hunting Motifs \u2013 Fort BelvedereShop HereIt\u2019s true that you could also change up the tie knot that you\u2019re using to use up more or less of the ties fabric relative to the tie length that you want. But, if you\u2019re using this method, then it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re not going to be using the correct tie knot all the time for the different shirt collars that you have.The result of this, of course, would be atie knot and collar combinationthat just looks off. And, seeing as wearing a collar and tie is meant to frame your face in the best possible light, we would say this is the detail to focus on; more so than the exact length of the overall tie.Furthermore, it\u2019s important to remember that for most of history, men actually wore their ties at a comparatively shorter length than men do today. Even when higher rise trousers were more commonplace. So, in reality, then, there\u2019s no one correct length for your ties to actually be, and we would simply recommend that you shoot for your waistband, as a general guideline.Raphael illustrates a good starting length for the ends of a necktie relative to the waistband before tying.As long as your tie isn\u2019t comically long or short, chances are you\u2019re going to look just fine. And if one or both of the ends up longer than you\u2019d like, you can simply tuck one or even both ends into your waistband to obscure this. And, after all, if you\u2019re wearing a jacket, sweater, or other outer layer, the end of your tie isn\u2019t even going to be visible, to begin with.So, the why behind having this rule in the first place is because a tie that goes down to your waistband is an aesthetically pleasing benchmark that\u2019s good to aim for when you\u2019re just starting out in the world of menswear. But, you don\u2019t have to be too obsessive about it.In today\u2019s hyper-casual world, after all, it\u2019s uplifting for us just to see a manwearing a necktiein the first place, so we shouldn\u2019t be getting out the tape measure to see if he\u2019s wearing it exactly right.Proper & Correct Tie Length ExplainedRead the GUIDE2. Forward-facing Trouser Pleats OnlyWe\u2019ve spoken aboutpleated pantsbefore, and there are some very divisive thoughts out there about just how these pleats should sit.At left: trousers with forward-facing pleats [Image Credit:Chester Cordite]At right: trousers with reverse pleats [Image Credit:Hansen\u2019s Clothing]There are really only two configurations of pleats that exist \u2013 those being either forward-facing or reverse pleats. A fair number of menswear traditionalists are going to tell you that the only proper way for trouser pleats to face is forward. The grand reasoning is that it\u2019s easier toironand maintain a trouser crease with forward-facing pleats.Practically speaking, yes, it is easier to get a sharp crease with a pair of forward-facing pleats, but should that really be the only consideration you have when adding a pair of trousers to your wardrobe?Remember, the two main functions of pleats are to allow for a greater range of movement while also allowing the trousers themselves to drape more attractively. And both forward-facing and reverse pleats accomplish this goal when thetrousersare made well. And while it is true that reverse pleats are somewhat more likely to billow or balloon, this is usually only going to be the case if the trousers aren\u2019t well-made or if they just don\u2019t fit your specific frame very well. So, just try out a few different options and consult your tailor to find out what works best for you.The two main functions of pleats are to allow for a greater range of movement while also allowing the trousers to drape more attractively.On the whole, though, we\u2019ve already addressed howpleated pants are much less common these days. So, whichever way your pleats face, just wear them with pride.3. No Tweed Jackets with JeansOur third rule that\u2019s made to be broken is that tweed jackets can\u2019t be worn withjeans. As we\u2019ve previously mentioned in other guides, menswear has become increasingly casual over the past few decades. Along with this, we\u2019re seeing a trend for mixing or co-mingling different formalities in garments \u2013 such as wearingsneakerswith suits or tweed jackets with denim jeans.To be clear, we\u2019re not really big fans of the first of these two looks because the formality levels of a suit and sneakers are just too different to look good together. But, we\u2019ve definitely seen plenty of traditionalists get pretty angry about the second of these combinations, as well.In our opinion, the formality levels of sneakers and suits are too different to look good together. [Image Credit:Suitsupply]Honestly, though, we really don\u2019t get why. Yes, it is true that a fulltweed suitcan be a joy to wear and one to behold. But, the reality is that tweed suits in their heyday were just as casual as denim jeans are today. Tweed suits and jackets have just moved up comparatively informalityin recent years and decades as more casual styles have been introduced.So, with tweed and denim both existing on the casual end of fabric choices and having their origins in work wear or other outdoor pursuits, they do make good pairing partners. The trick to getting the look right, then, is just to ensure that the cut of both your jacket and jeans are complementary.In its heyday, a tweed suit was just as casual as denim jeans are today. (Tieandpocket squareby Fort Belvedere)As long as the jacket isn\u2019t too structured or formal and the jeans aren\u2019t too tight or overly embellished with unnecessary details, you can put together stylish looks that are surprisingly versatile in the 21st Century. And, of course, if you want more tips on wearing jeans with odd jackets, you can consult our guide on that topic.Should You Wear Jeans with a Jacket?READ THE ARTICLE4. No Brown in TownMost of us have probably heard the phrase \u201cno brown in town\u201d somewhere before. Essentially, this rule is about setting the formality of the types of clothing that men would wear in different situations.Being in a built up area where a man would have been expected to be doing business or finding himself in other formal situations \u2013 otherwise known as being \u201cin town\u201d \u2013 would historically have required dark, somber clothing of a more formal tone, as well as black footwear.Once only appropriate for country wear, brown shoes can now be dressed up or down.Meanwhile, if you were in thecountryside, a pair of brown shoes was virtually a requirement as they would harmonize better with your surroundings and would do a good job of obscuring any dirt that you might encounter. In other words, simple common sense and color theory are at play here.For the most part, this rule is outdated. By the way, as we mentioned in our older guide onrules to ignore, 19th Century rules like these about when to wear brown, white, or other colors were ultimately a way for the old money aristocracy to easily socially separate themselves from the new moneynouveau riche, as well as from the lower classes.Needless to say then, this type of classism and social stratification doesn\u2019t have any place in the 21st Century.5. No Brown Shoes with a SuitSpeaking of prohibitions on brown brings us nicely to our fifth rule for today, which is thatbrown shoescan\u2019t be worn with a suit. The traditionalists out there argue that considering brown can\u2019t be worn in town, then, logically, the only shoes that go with a business suit are black, full stop.In short, though, this one just feels pretty ridiculous in today\u2019s modern world, where creating a harmonious look is going to be more comfortable for you and aesthetically pleasing for others.As long as your outfit is working together harmoniously, brown shoes can absolutely be worn with a suit.Now that brown is allowed in town, it\u2019s just silly to say that blue, gray, and, of course, brown suits can\u2019t be worn with brown or burgundy shoes, especially sinceblue and brownandgray and brownare classic pairings in menswear.So, we\u2019ll dismiss this one simply by saying, yes, brown shoes absolutely can be worn with a suit. Just make sure that everything is working together harmoniously.6A. All Metals Must MatchWe\u2019re breaking up our next rule into two parts, so we\u2019ll start here with rule 6A: that all of your metals in an outfit must match. We\u2019ve previously made a guide all about how tomatch your various leathers and metalsand you should definitely check it out for a few pointers.The insistence that every metal on your outfit should match is unrealistic.What we\u2019re zeroing in on here is the insistence that every metal item you\u2019re wearing has to match exactly; and, realistically, this is, well, unrealistic. Items ofjewelry, including watches, typically carry a sentimental value for most people. And whether it\u2019s a family heirloom, a religious piece, or something that commemorates a special time in your life, most people are going to wear their jewelry with far more purpose than the other elements of their outfit.A better guideline is to ensure that all metal elements in your outfit harmonize well rather than match exactly.What this supposed rule does is massively reduce the amount of variety that you can incorporate into any one single outfit. For example, if somebody wears a goldwedding bandbut receives a silver-toned watch as an heirloom, should they always have to choose which one they want to wear? Of course, not a much better guideline would be ensuring that all of the metal elements in your outfit harmonize well, rather than matching exactly.6B. All Leather Elements Must MatchFor the next rule, there are additional layers to look at as not only do you have to consider the color of the leather, but also the type of skin and the finish. And it\u2019s pretty clear that the skin types and finishes don\u2019t always have to match throughout an entire outfit. And remember, as quality leather goods are made from natural products, it would be almost impossible to find multiple hides that matched exactly for all of your different wardrobe elements.Quality leather goods (like thse bespoke shoes) are made from natural products, so finding abelt to match them exactly would be a challenge!As we hope we\u2019ve already demonstrated, differentleather typescan create beautiful contrast. So, when it comes to different leather colors, we can apply the same reasoning that we did for metals, which is to say: harmony is king here.If we look at the sharply dressed agents of theKingsmanfilm series, for example, we can see that their shoes don\u2019t match the color or the leather type of their watch straps, but it\u2019s important to take a step back and look at the outfit as a whole. These pieces don\u2019t match exactly, but the outfit still works on the whole because they\u2019re of a similar level of formality. And, of course, who doesn\u2019t want to look as cool as a super-spy?It\u2019s important to take a step back and take a look at the outfit as a whole.In the broad strokes, remember that the reason behind these rules is assisting men who are first getting into classic menswear to assemble outfits that look more harmonious. And while it\u2019s never going to look bad if you make sure that the leather and metal elements in your outfit match exactly, remember that the overall aim is just that your outfit looks harmonious and that no single element is overpowering.7. No Short-sleeved, Button-up ShirtsRule number seven is that a true gentleman doesn\u2019t own any short-sleeved, button-up shirts. Well, as you can see, I think that one\u2019s just patently false. For a bit of context here, I just thought I\u2019d let you know that I do personally enjoy wearing short-sleeved, button-ups from time to time, and I wanted to let other men know that it isn\u2019t universally against the laws of fashion.That being said, it\u2019s not hard to understand where this rule comes from; it\u2019s our old friend class stratification again. Prior to World War II, short-sleeved shirts were actually fairly uncommon in western menswear. Men would simply own long-sleeved shirts androll the sleeves upif they were hot or needed to engage in manual labor.Short-sleeved shirts used to be specialist sporting garments.Otherwise, short-sleeved shirts were specialist sporting garments like theLacoste polo shirt, for example. And the stigma around short-sleeved button-ups, in particular, likely comes from just after the war in the 50s and 60s, where they became a staple of the working class for their practical design.Not only that, but short-sleeved shirts can also carry a bit of a historical association with younger children \u2013 again, for practical reasons. After all, getting the sleeve length exactly right on a growing child can be a bit of a fool\u2019s errand.Although this rule focuses heavily on these reasons, it also forgets that many stylish men throughout history have worn short-sleeved shirts well \u2013 with the1950sand \u201960s, in particular, often having some of the best examples. We should say that there is a bit of a distinction to be found here.Many stylish men throughout history have worn short-sleeved shirts well. [Image Credit: (L-R)Vogue.com,Standard.co.uk]The examples we\u2019ve just shown, along with polo shirts, are most properly called \u201csport shirts.\u201d The more casual styling details of these shirts \u2013 like thicker fabrics, bolder colors or patterns, or non-business stylecollars\u2013 differentiate them from short-sleeveddress shirts.These types of shirts, on the other hand, which are essentially just standard business shirts with short sleeves, aren\u2019t terribly stylish, again, because of the inherent clash of formalities within the garment. But, their sporty cousins need not be frowned upon and, indeed, they can even be worn under a jacket, provided the entire outfit is deliberately casual and especially if it\u2019s being worn in ahot climate.Keys are to find shirts that have a slimmer, more flattering fit in both the body and the arms, and you can even leave things untucked if you\u2019re not wearing an outer layer, of course.Find shirts that have a slimmer, more flattering fit in both the body and the arms.Remember, you\u2019re not trying to make a sports shirt look overly formal, just put together. So, let the weather and the formality scale be your guide here and, overall, don\u2019t be afraid to free the forearm once in a while.The Formality Scale: How Clothes Rank From Formal To InformalRead the GUIDE8. Black Tie and White TieFinally, today, we get to number eight: Black Tie and White Tie rules. These ones, you actually probably should follow. So, yes, we\u2019ve included these here as a bit of a fake-out, but bear with us.The Black Tie and White Tie dress codes are the most formal ones in which a typical man is going to be expected to dress these days.The Black Tie (pictured here) and White Tie dress codes are ones that you should attempt to follow closely.This, of course, is something that the red carpet regrettably fails to take note of, most of the time, as formal events that require these dress codes though, are much less common than they used to be.These rules are the ones you really ought to follow in order to respect the formality of the event. Plus, if you\u2019re following these rules correctly, you\u2019re pretty much guaranteed to be the best-dressed person in attendance since Black Tie and White Tie were explicitly designed to enhance the aesthetics of the male form.Following these rules correctly will pretty much guarantee that you will be the best-dressed person in attendance.Fort BelvedereDark Magenta Purple Lotus Flower Silk Boutonniere Lapel Pin Flower \u2013 Fort BelvedereShop HereFort BelvedereWhite Tie in Marcella Pique Bow Tie Self Tie Butterfly \u2013 Fort BelvedereShop HereAnd if you feel that you don\u2019t know all of these rules and there are plenty of them, don\u2019t worry because we\u2019ve got you covered in our comprehensiveBlack TieandWhite Tieguides on our website. We\u2019ve also got guides toformal day wearas well, so be sure to take a look.With that said, while there are several more rules that relate to Black Tie and White Tie, you don\u2019t have to think of them as being overly restrictive.These guidelines exist to allow for maximum enjoyment while you\u2019re at these events for which you\u2019ve donned abow tie. And yes, it should be a bow tie. So, by looking into the reasons behind the various rules associated with formal wear and by doing a bit of planning, you\u2019re sure to look stylish at any formal event.The most important thing is to understand the greater background of these rules, then learn to implement them wisely but with moderation or other considerations.For all of the other rules that we listed today, though, remember that the most important thing isn\u2019t being obsessed with the letter of the law. It\u2019s understanding the greater background context for how these rules came to be in the first place and then implementing them wisely, but with moderation or other considerations here and there.ConclusionThose were the several sartorial citations that sidelined successfully. We hope you\u2019ve gotten a hint on when, where, and how to break these rules to look and feel confident in your outfits!So, what\u2019s your take on our rule-breaking, and do you have any other rules that you\u2019d like for us to add to the list?

Meanwhile, I\u2019ve tried to harmonize them somewhat with my belt, which is one of our modular belts from Fort Belvedere, but this is a darker, more conventional menswear color. Even so, you\u2019re not going to see the belt much under my untucked shirt, so it really doesn\u2019t matter that the leathers of my shoes and belt don\u2019t match exactly.The buckle, by the way, is in silver and it\u2019s the model we call the Jasper, and it also doesn\u2019t directly correspond to my wedding band, which is in more of a gold color.Preston displaying a natural, no-product hairstyle.But what are the 10 Commandments of Classic Style?Read the ArticleTo go along with this casual feel, I\u2019ve also left theproductout of my hair today.

Now obviously, there is a big disconnect and just having the casual dress code is no longer enough. So if you get an invitation with a dress code smart casual, I hear your pain.What Exactly Is Smart Casual For Men?Historically, the term was coined because people showed up overly casual and the smart implied that you can\u2019t show up with joggers and trainers. If you look at the urban dictionary, it defines smart casual as a nonsensical dress code that people slap on to events, parties, and workplaces. Completely down to interpretation, this always causes confusion and often spectacular results. The mixture between smart and casual should not be taken literally. So while it\u2019s hilarious, sadly, it\u2019s not very helpful.Smart casual attire [Image Credit:Pinterest]First, theurban dictionarygot it right by saying don\u2019t take it literally. That means, don\u2019t weartennisshoes with a dress shirt, or combine sweatpants with ablazer. So in a nutshell, smart casual is not about mixing different pieces of clothing from differentdegrees of formalitybut rather to pick something that is in between a very casual outfit and a formal or businesslike outfit. A hoodie would be too casual andpleated wool dress pantswould be too formal, instead, if you go with chinos, they are less formal, as well as apolo shirt, you hit that perfect sweet spot of smart casual.Personally, I like the idea of a smart casual dress code because it allows you to use lots of colors and to combine different things that you may not have combined otherwise. Ideally, you always want to avoid looks at the extreme end of the spectrum, that means nojeans, no trainers, no hoodies, or no sweatpants. At the same time, it also means noneckwear, nosuits, no pleatedpants, and no blackdress shoes.Where Do You Encounter Men\u2019s Smart Casual Dress Code?It\u2019s not at the office because there are different terms such asbusiness casual. You can usually find smart casual dress codes in a social environment such ascruise ships, restaurants, orresorts. The whole idea is to look neat and presentable without being overly stuffy.Men in smart casual attire [Image Credit:Pinterest]So let\u2019s say you work in a white-collar office and you have an invitation to a smart casual event afterward and you usually wear dress shirts,ties, andpinstripe suits, you definitely want to bring a change of clothes. If you\u2019re a bit more flexible at the office, you can get away with wearing a blazer and chinos for example, as well as a tie, but when you go to the smart casual party, I suggest taking off the tie, add a boldpocket square, maybe aboutonniere, have some boldersocksand shoes andbrowntones or more colors such as dark red, darkgreen, or navy, and it just creates a more fun outfit that is not as boring or stuffy formal as you would usually know from anoffice environment.Should You Dress Up Or Down?So if you\u2019re unsure whether you should dress up a little more or dress down, I suggest you always dress up because that way, you don\u2019t embarrass yourself. Of course, always stay within that smart casual range which means below business wear.A tweed blazer with chinos for a dapper yet modern take on a classic [Image Credit:Quora]Smart Casual Men\u2019s Clothing ItemsA Stand Out Blazer Or Odd JacketOn the formal side would be an odd jacket or a blazer. Odd jacket meaning it has a bolder pattern, another color, and it doesn\u2019t match the pants. You don\u2019t want to wear a suit, a combination at most. Also, that means, don\u2019t wear orphaned suit jackets from your pinstripe suit with a Nantucket red pair of pants because it\u2019s simply odd and doesn\u2019t work together.Harrington Jacket in Racing Green fromBaracuta[Image Credit:Baracuta]Of course, if you want to be more casual with your jacket choice, you can absolutely do that. You could go with aHarrington jacketincotton, maybe a linen jacket such as this green one, I would even argue you could wear abomber jacketor maybe a leather jacket if that suits the overall outfit.Smart casual large checked shirt [Iage Credit:Bucco Couture]Checked Collared ShirtsWhen it comes to shirts, you should definitely stay clear oft-shirtsbut you can wear dress shirts. That being said, I suggest not to wear plain white or solid lightbluedress shirts because they\u2019re true business formal. Instead, go with checked shirts in a collar. You can also go with bolderchecks, smaller checks may be a small houndstooth or a bolder stripe. It all works, just make sure there\u2019s some contrast, there\u2019s some color, and it\u2019s not too stiff. If you live in a warmer climate, linen shirts are perfectly fine. Personally, I would always stay clear of short-sleeved dress shirts and instead go with polo shirts because it\u2019s more natural and works better.Cuffed chinos offer a casual balance when paired with a jacket and tie [Image Credit:Pinterest]Chinos, Corduroys, Seersucker, & Linen PantsWhen it comes to pants or slacks, don\u2019t wear jeans and don\u2019t wear pleated pants made out ofworsted woolbecause that\u2019soffice wearand both of them are too extreme. Instead, go with chinos, maybecorduroysin the winter,seersuckeror linen in thesummeror something with a bit more texture that\u2019s interesting and it could also have a pattern such as a small houndstooth for example.Black Corduroy With Tan Boots [Shoelaces:Vintage Pink Shoelaces Round \u2013 Waxed Cotton Dress Shoe Laces Luxury by Fort Belvedere]Colorful AccessoriesWhen it comes to accessories, color is your friend. You can be much bolder than at the office and you can experiment and simply have fun. I suggest you skipbowtiesand regular neckties. if you want to have something around your neck, maybe anascotcan be the perfect item.If you decide to wear a blazer or an odd jacket, I strongly recommend you wear a bold pocket square or maybe a boutonniere that is just contrasting, it\u2019s a pop of color, it\u2019s different, and it\u2019s fun. Definitely, avoid thewhite linen pocket squarein TV fold, that\u2019s fine for ajob interviewor the office but not for smart casual.Sand Chukka bootswith green corduroys andburgundy and sand stripes socksAnother way I like to spice up smart casual outfits is to usecolorful socks. You could be bolder, you can experiment, you can go really out there, or you can be a little more subdued. Personally, I want a subdued side.Burgundy Unlined Lamb Suede Gloves with Green Contrast Leather Button Gloves \u2013 Fort BelvedereIf it\u2019s cold outside and you need some gloves, I suggest to go with fun colors such as dark green, maybe a light tan, blue, or red, and stay clear of the traditional black gloves, or just boring brown gloves. That being said, if you want to stick with those colors, make sure you get two-toned gloves such as the black and red gloves by Fort Belvedere or the brown and blue gloves which are definitely not your Grandpa\u2019s gloves.Stick With Leather ShoesWingtip spectatorderby shoeswithMid Brown Socks with Green and Cream Clocks by Fort Belvederewith brown trousersWhen it comes to shoes, I suggest you stay with leather shoes. They can have a leather sole or a rubber sole but they must not beblackbecause that\u2019s too formal. Instead, go with brown tones or tans but you can also venture into green, maybe off-white, or dark burgundy red. All these colors are acceptable but I urge you to choose a style that is more casual with more casual details. As such,spectatorswork. You can go with woven leather, or maybe a linen insert, suede is also good.Brown Derby Shoes withLight Blue Shoelaces by Fort Belvedere\u2013 Before & AfterJust get something that\u2019s more casual than a traditional business shoe. That being said,derbiesare more appropriate thanoxfordsbut there are oxfords that would be just fine for smart casual as long as they are not too dark and they have maybe a full brogue pattern.Fringed two-tone tassel loaferApart from that, I think two tonetassel loafersare great or maybe just regular penny loafers, some people even likedriving moccseven though I think they wear very quickly if you wear them on a daily basis but they work from a concept point of view.Classic boat shoes byRancourtOn a very casual end, I suggest shoes go withboat shoesbecause they are still leather and they\u2019re still relaxed and you can even wear them barefoot. While it\u2019s clear that tennis shoes and trainers are too casual, a lot of people like designer sneakers or leather sneakers and in my opinion, they\u2019re in a gray area. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t wear it because I find it too casual but I know other people who would probably find a sneaker still appropriate.CONCLUSIONAt the end of the day, it\u2019s your call. Personally, I\u2019d always urge you to get a little bit more formal within the smart casual dress code because that way, you always look dapper and properly attired. No one will turn you down, everyone will respect you, and they will know that you understood the smart casual dress code.Outfit RundownRaphael wearing a smart-casual outfit.Fort BelvedereReversible Scarf in Burgundy Red and Blue Silk Wool Motifs and Paisleyshop hereFort BelvedereMid Brown and Green Shadow Stripe Ribbed Socks Fil d'Ecosse Cottonshop hereFort BelvederePetrol Blue Men's Gloves with Button in Lamb Nappa Leathershop hereI am wearing a smart casual outfit that I could wear during the colder days of the year.

      "body": "Black Tie and White Tie MattersOverlooked Benefits of Formal Dress CodesSocial GuidepostsAt the turn of the twentieth-century,dress codeswere rigid and extensive protocols that prescribed specific attire for every conceivable social and leisure activity, and tolerated little deviation. One hundred years later, we have rid ourselves of such excessive constraints only to discover that along with the proverbial Edwardian bathwater, we have also thrown out some very valuable benefits.Table of ContentsExpandCollapseOverlooked Benefits of Formal Dress CodesScale of Evening Dress CodesFormal Gray Areas: Overdress or Underdress?Black-and-White Clarity: Interpreting Dress CodesA major drawback of discarding dress standards is clearly spelled out by Britain\u2019s authoritative etiquette guide,Debrett\u2019s New Guide to Etiquette and Modern Manners:\u201cIndecision about what to wear is one of the most visible manifestations of contemporary social confusion and insecurity. The elevation of comfort above all other considerations, the flawed belief that informality equals conviviality, and downright laziness have resulted in a contradictory and illogical dress sense.\u201dIt is therefore ironic that the appearance of theBlack Tiedress code on an invitation causes panic in so many men. Unfamiliar with the concept, they view the looming event as an intimidating test of sartorial skills which they know are sadly lacking. No wonder style and etiquette advisors frequently begin their instruction to men with a reminder that the Black Tie \u201ctest\u201d comes with a complete set of answers guaranteed to ensure top grades to any student that follows them. AsMen\u2019sWardrobeso succinctly puts it: \u201cBlack tie is your friend, not your enemy.\u201dVintage Garden Party Invitation; note the dress codeSense of OccasionIn addition to providing clarity and self-confidence, prescribed attire also helps to generate a sense of occasion. Combined with a specific code of conduct it fashions a social ritual that elevates one type of happening above another. Finerestaurantsmay go to great lengths to provide a more elegant atmosphere than a local pub, for example, but if their customers import typical pub clothing and behavior then these establishments are robbed of much of their special character. Unfortunately, this fact is increasingly evident in today\u2019s world as the once noble quest to end aristocratic snobbery manifests itself in a growing culture of democratic slobbery.Act of ConsiderationJust as a host or hostess can show consideration towards guests by providing clear dress guidelines, so does a guest return the favor by being mature enough to honor them. As Debrett\u2019s author John Morgan so eloquently points out \u201cby being seen to make an effort you are paying your host or hostess a great compliment, as well as making yourself look your most attractive. After all, the short time required for getting yourself dressed is negligible compared with the hours the hostess might have put in preparing the party.\u201d This is particularly true for formal dress codes where ignoring the prescribed etiquette will make it clear that you could not care less about the desires of your host or the experience of your fellow guests.If dress codes are respectfully followed, any event will have a heightened sense of occasion.Scale of Evening Dress Codes(D)evolution of Formal\u201cFormal\u201d is defined as maintaining a form or tradition and so formal wear is distinctive for preserving sartorial customs of previous times. Although it evolves with changing fashions evening wear deliberately remains a step or two behind them in a process much like a slow-motion ripple effect. When a new standard in daywear splashes onto the sartorial scene the previous norm is pushed out to the realm of formal evening wear which in turn drives prior evening garb to the outer circles of very formal dress and ultimately consigns the previous occupant of that position to the fashion history books.Formal, Semi-Formal and InformalWhile there once was a near-universal consensus of what defined \u201cformal\u201d clothing, the concept has become highly subjective in today\u2019s world.During Victorian and Edwardian times, the term applied to virtually any evening that included mixed company and such occasions demanded men be attired in full dress;dinner jacketswere considered distinctly \u201cinformal\u201d and were confined to stag affairs. After the First World War, standards were relaxed and formal was redefined as occasions of prestige and ceremony while the honorific \u201csemi-formal\u201d was applied to the tuxedo which had replaced the tailcoat as de facto evening wear.World War II prompted a further loosening of social mores including the acceptance of the common suit at typical evening affairs and the consequent elevation of the dinner jacket to special occasion attire. While some communities maintained the pre-war dress codes, other segments of society that rarely wore tailcoats began to classify the tuxedo as formal and the suit as semi-formal. This new interpretation became increasingly popular during the 1960s and 1970s when the arrival of suchcasualgarments as the leisure suit and turtleneck as acceptable day wear bumped the regularsuitfurther up the dress code ladder which in turn promoted the tuxedo\u2019s formality and all but guaranteed the redundancy of the tailcoat.Today, when it is not uncommon for men to wearT-shirtsto theofficeand sandals to the theater, the concept of formal is even more ambiguous and can mean anything from a tuxedo to a dark suit to a black shirt with designerjeans. A casualty of individualism\u2019s triumph over communalism, traditional dress codes are now largely redundant outside of weddings, one of the last bastions of middle-class formal ritual. (For complete details of how the codes are interpreted in this context see Formal Evening Weddings.)Dress Codes Formality ScaleFormal Gray Areas: Overdress or Underdress?Clearly, interpreting dress codes today is far more complicated than it was in years past. AsA Gentleman Gets Dressed Upexplains, the best solution for uncertain guests is to seek clarification:If a gentleman has any doubts as to what he should wear to a wedding \u2013 or any other ceremonial occasion, no matter how formal or informal, \u2013 he feels free to contact his host or hostess, simply asking \u201cwhat do you think most of the fellows there will be wearing?\u201d He does not content himself with asking uninformed friends, \u201cWell, Jack, what do YOU think I ought to do?\u201dWhen such clarification is not possible, experts are divided on whether to risk being underdressed or overdressed. One school of thought includes the authors ofA Gentleman Gets Dressed Upwho feel that \u201cthe former may be interpreted as a simple misunderstanding [while] the latter suggests conscious premeditation.\u201d In the opposing camp are pundits suchSir Hardy Amies, a British authority on menswear, who pointed out it that is easier for an overdressed man to relax his manner (and his tie) than it would be for an underdressed man to change his clothes. \u201cCorrect dressing is only another form of good manners,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand good manners are only another form of mental comfort.\u201dHowever, the social stakes are much higher with formal wear due to its highly specialized nature. No matter how noble your intentions, you will very likely be perceived as pretentious if your tuxedo turns out to be the only one in the room. (If you deliberately choose to put yourself in this position \u2013 or if you dress in white tie for a black tie event \u2013 that perception will be quite justified.)Ultimately, though, there is absolutely no reason for the confusing gray areas caused by ambiguous traditional dress codes. Thoughtful hosts can instead use alternative codes that state their intentions in black and white.If the hosts of an event are open to some interpretation, one should simply try his best to look smart, and not worry about overdressing.Black-and-White Clarity: Interpreting Dress Codes\u201cWhite Tie\u201d, \u201cBlack Tie\u201dAs the interpretation of \u201cformal\u201d and \u201cinformal\u201d became progressively more subjective in the second half of the twentieth century, hosts increasingly turned to codes that literally spell out the required attire.At the dressiest end of the scale, the appearance ofWhite Tie(or Evening Dress in the UK) on an invitation announced that male guests are required to wear a tailcoat with the appropriate accoutrements while the ladies were expected to wear ball gowns. Black Tie (or Dinner Jackets in the UK) declared that traditional tuxedos and evening gowns were required. For the least formal evening affairs, Business Attire (or Lounge Suit or Don\u2019t Change in the UK) allowed guests to attend in conservative suits.By the sartorial nadir of the 1970s, powder blue leisure suit ensembles were considered \u201cformal attire.\u201d\u201cBlack Tie\u201d VariationsThis black-and-white three-tier system worked perfectly for decades until declining dress standards introduced a slew of ambiguous deviations. The advent of \u201cbusiness casual\u201d in the 1990s muddied the universal concept of business attire and hosts of informal parties consequently grasped for more descriptive alternatives forcing their guests to decipher such vague codes as Dressy Casual orCocktail Attire. Similarly, the 1970s reinvention of formal attire led to a number of confusing variations of the Black Tie theme that were counterintuitive to the dress code\u2019s role as a tool for clarity and uniformity. The following page defines these variations and, more importantly, explains why they are to be avoided.Ladies\u2019 Formal AttireKing Willem-Alexander And Queen Maxima Of The Netherlands Visit New ZealandWith generic dress codes such as semi-formal or formal, a man\u2019s choice of suit or tuxedo is often determined by the formality of the women\u2019s dresses which varies by local custom.Conversely, the explicit Black Tie and White Tie dress codes require the women to match the formality of the men\u2019s attire. For more information, seeLadies\u2019 Evening Wear.\u201cDon\u2019t Change\u201d / \u201cUnchanged\u201dDebrett\u2019s New Guide to Etiquette and Modern Mannersdescribes this unique British evening dress code as follows:\u201cThis used to mean come as you are, but in a day when men where probably wearing suits and women the equivalent . Nowadays the term, unless the hosts say differently, means not black tie. Thus men should turn up in suits or jackets and trousers with a formal shirt, cuff links and a tie. Women wear presentable day clothes.\u201dContemporary Evening Dress CodesThe myriad of modern dress codes such asDressy Casual,Festive AttireorCocktail Attireare beyond the realm of this Guide as they are highly arbitrary and do not pertain to formal wear.Explore this chapter: 2Black Tie & Tuxedo Etiquette2.1Definition: What Is Black Tie, Tux or Tuxedo2.2What is White Tie?

That\u2019s selvedge denim.It\u2019s become a badge of honour among denimheads, a shorthand for quality. But despite what many think, selvedge doesn\u2019t mean raw. It doesn\u2019t mean handmade. And it doesn\u2019t mean indestructible.Let\u2019s clear up what it actuallydoesmean\u2014and why it matters.TL;DR \u2014 Quick SummarySelvedge denimis woven on old-style shuttle looms that produce self-finished edges.It\u2019s usually narrower and slower to produce than modern denim.Selvedge denim is often\u2014but not always\u2014sold raw (i.e. unwashed).It\u2019s prized for its texture, irregularities, and how it fades over time.Not inherently stronger or more durable\u2014but definitely more characterful.WORTH BUYING RIGHT NOW \u2013 EDITOR\u2019S PICKSThe Best N1 Jackets on the MarketOriginally built for U.S. Navy sailors braving icy decks, the Deck Jacket is still one of the most dependable winter jackets.

There\u2019s no need to trim or overlock the fabric. The result is a neat border that doesn\u2019t fray.\u201cSelvedge\u201d is also commonly spelled \u201cselvage\u201d in American English. Both refer to the same thing: the self-finished edge of shuttle-loomed denim.That edge is often highlighted with a coloured yarn\u2014most famously red, known asredline selvedge.\ud83d\udc49Important:\u201cSelvedge\u201d tells you how the fabric is woven. It doesnotmean the denim is raw (unwashed), nor does raw denim have to be selvedge.How Selvedge Denim Is MadeThere are two main ways to weave denim: with a shuttle or without one.Shuttle Weaving (Selvedge Denim)A shuttle loom passes the weft yarn back and forth across the warp in a continuous motion. This creates a narrow fabric\u2014usually about 30 inches wide\u2014with clean edges.Because these machines are slower and harder to maintain, production is limited. But the result is fabric with natural slubs, soft handfeel, and a lo-fi texture that denimheads can\u2019t get enough of.Shuttleless Weaving (Standard Denim)Most denim today is made on projectile looms. Instead of a shuttle, a bullet-shaped device fires the weft yarn across. It\u2019s faster, wider, and far more efficient.But it leaves frayed edges that need to be cut off\u2014so the fabric is cheaper, but loses that distinctive selvedge edge and character.You can read much more about weavinghere.Watch: What Is Selvedge Denim?Prefer video? Here\u2019s a quick explanation from Thomas that breaks it down with visuals.Is Selvedge Always Raw?Nope. Selvedge denim can be raw, but it can also be pre-washed, and even have stretch.Likewise, not all raw denim is selvedge. Plenty of mills produce raw denim on modern looms.But raw and selvedgeoftendo go hand-in-hand. That\u2019s because both raw and selvedge appeal to the same type of wearer\u2014someone who values quality, evolution, and the long game.The Guy Who Built This Site Has Launched a Brand!It\u2019s called Weirloom, and the newWL#1 Regular Fitjeans are complete with a leather patch, branded buttons, and a new woven label.Learn more and buy a pair here.Why Is Selvedge Denim More Expensive?A few reasons:Slower production: Shuttle looms weave at a fraction of the speed of modern machines.Narrower fabric: Less yield per roll means more cutting waste.More hands-on: Old looms require constant tweaking, repairs, and experience to run properly.Smaller batches: Selvedge denim is often produced by mills focused on craftsmanship, not scale.In short: You\u2019re paying for time, care, and heritage. And for a fabric that tells a story.Above: A mid-century-inspired selvedge denim from Cone Mills, woven as a reproduction of the fabric used in Levi\u2019s 501ZXX.How to Spot Selvedge DenimLook for:Coloured edge yarns(often red) running down the outseam\u2014best seen when the jeans are cuffed.Product description: Most brands will highlight it (if it\u2019s selvedge, they\u2019ll make sure you know).Why Denimheads Love SelvedgeIt\u2019s not just about the fabric. It\u2019s about the philosophy.Selvedge denim is part of a broader movement that favourscraft over convenience,slowness over scale, andstories over trends. It taps into the same ethos behind loopwheel knits, Goodyear-welted boots, and handmade leather goods.Put simply: It\u2019s the kind of denim you buy to wear, fade, and maybe even hand down one day.Is Selvedge Denim Better?That depends on what you mean by \u201cbetter.\u201dIf we\u2019re talking aboutdurability, not necessarily. A well-made pair of non-selvedge jeans can outlast selvedge. But if we\u2019re talkingfades, texture, and character\u2014selvedge wins every time.Why?Slubs: Shuttle looms tolerate irregularities in the yarn, which creates texture and uneven fading.Less tension: Slower weaving puts less stress on the yarn, resulting in a softer feel.Personal evolution: Raw selvedge denim develops unique fades based on how you wear it.It\u2019s less about technical superiority and more about emotional resonance. Selvedge jeans aren\u2019t just worn\u2014they\u2019re lived in.Looking for Your Next Pair of Jeans?Our Buying Guides help you find the best raw and selvedge denim\u2014whether you\u2019re after fit, weight, or where it\u2019s made.

Are the pockets shaped and placed in flattering ways? Are there any details that attract either positive or negative attention? Bonus points for denimhead-pleasing details like hidden rivets, tucked belt loops, peekaboo selvedge, and lined back pockets.Character:Selvedge lovers love to get up close with their denim, appreciating it at an almost microscopic level. They\u2019re looking forcharacter\u2014a product of the beautiful dance between (usually) indigo and white yarns.Construction:Stitching should be clean, tight, and as straight as an arrow. Unravelling stitches or loose threads are a surefire sign that quality control isn\u2019t up to snuff. Construction issues tend to reveal themselves with time, so a brand\u2019s reputation for durability is extremely important here.Cut:Does the pair flatter a wide range of bodies? Models make everything look good. How good does the pair look on average joes?Fades:How is the denim\u2019s inner beauty revealed through use and abuse? Pairs take at least a year to fade properly. Are the fades this pair can produce worth waiting for?Brand Values:Has the brand gone out of their way to make their product ethically, close to home, and to an exceptionally high standard? If they profess values, are they transparent enough that we can see these values in practice?Iron Heart 634S (21 oz.)Classics never die, and Iron Heart\u2019s 21 oz. selvedge was born a classic.

Starting with a single pair of selvedge jeans, they quickly gained a cult following for their commitment to Japanese selvedge and raw denim.For over two decades, Nudie has been an innovator in denim while maintaining a strong focus on quality and sustainability, with selvedge denim still central to their collection.Like so many denimheads that also \u201ccame of age\u201d in the late 2000s, Nudie was a gateway brand for me. My most cherished pair is an Average Joe, made from the original Kaihara selvedge. I wore them daily for about five months without an initial soak, leading to distinctive \u2018scars\u2019 and breaks after the first wash\u2014a learning experience that challenged the common wait-6-months-before-you-wash approach.This profile explores the current top picks of Nudie\u2019sjeans fitsand their selection ofJapanese selvedge denim.Denimhunters is reader-supported.

And as it should be for loose-fitting jeans, Tuff Tony comes with abutton fly.Tuff Tony is designed for those with anaverage to athletic build.Its generous fit around the legs and hips offers a roomy silhouette, but like with Rad Rufus, it may not be ideal for those with a larger midsection, as the high waist can highlight the belly.Key Features:Loose Fit: Provides a roomy, comfortable feel.High Waist: Sits above the natural waistline, best suited for those with a straighter figure.Button Fly: Traditional closure for a classic look.Tuff Tony - Dry Ace Selvage (14 oz.)Tuff Tony - Snake Eyes Selvage (13 oz.)Tuff Tony - Dry Deluxe (Kaihara non-selvedge)NUDIE\u2019S JAPANESE SELVEDGE DENIMSNudie\u2019s Japanese selvedge denims marry traditional craftsmanship with modern sustainability, using 100% organic cotton exclusively.These jeans start raw and rugged, featuring a tightly woven selvedge edge\u2014a hallmark of shuttle loom weaving that results in a clean, self-finished edge.Whether you\u2019re just getting into raw denim or are a seasoned fan, Nudie\u2019s range of Japanese selvedge denims brings a distinct character to your denim journey.Dry Selvage: 13.75 oz. (Kaihara)This is the OG denim for Nudie; a selvedge that\u2019s been a cornerstone since the brand\u2019s launch in 2001. The story of this denim started in 2000 when Nudie founder, Maria Erixon\u2014then working for Lee Europe\u2014encountered a fabric sample at a fabric week in Brussels.This sample, from Kaihara in Japan, captured her attention immediately. Although the denim was too expensive for Lee at the time, Maria brought it home as a cherished souvenir. This little piece of denim inspired her to make it the foundation of Nudie when she founded the brand in 2001.The 13.75 oz. denim is tightly woven and features a rugged yet relatively clean texture, thanks to its slubby yarns\u2014adding a slightly uneven, authentic feel. Initially featuring a red selvedge ID, it was changed to orange in 2011, becoming a unique signature for Nudie. Like all Nudie\u2019s denims, the cotton is 100% organic.Key Features:Weight: 13.75 oz.Yarns: Slubby, giving a slightly uneven and authentic textureSelvedge ID: Orange (changed from red in 2011)Composition: 100% organic cotton (since 2012)Source: Kaihara in Hiroshima, JapanGritty Jackson - Dry Selvage (13.75 oz.)Rad Rufus - Dry Selvage (13.75 oz.)Steady Eddie II - Dry Selvage (13.75 oz.)Dry Ace: 14 oz. (Shinya)Dry Ace is a 14 oz. denim woven by the renowned Shinya Mills. Based in Japan, Shinya has a storied reputation for its meticulous craftsmanship and innovative approach to denim weaving. Their expertise shines through in this fabric, which is a faithful nod to denim\u2019s golden era.The story of Dry Ace began with a deep dive into the past. Shinya Mills meticulously analysed a pair of well-worn jeans from the 1950s, replicating its unique qualities. During the 40s and 50s, limited yarn-spinning technology resulted in uneven, slubby yarns, which Shinya has masterfully recreated in Dry Ace.This denim might seem a bit rustic at first glance, with its chunky and rugged texture, but that\u2019s part of its charm. It starts out raw and a bit rough around the edges, but as you wear and wash it, Dry Ace transforms, revealing a beautiful salt-and-pepper texture that\u2019s both distinctive and timeless.This 100% organic cotton denim undergoes 20 dips in pure indigo, resulting in a rich, redcast hue that celebrates the imperfections of traditional denim.Key Features:Weight: 14 oz.Yarns: Uneven, slubby texture inspired by vintage denimColour: Redcast, achieved through 20 dips in pure indigoComposition: 100% organic cottonSource: Shinya Mills, JapanSteady Eddie II - Dry Ace (14 oz.)Tuff Tony - Dry Ace Selvage (14 oz.)Gritty Jackson - Dry Ace (14 oz.)Dry Ace is also available in theJonas Shirt.Snake Eyes: 13 oz. (Shinya)Snake Eyes is a marbled marvel, brought to life by Shinya Mills in Kojima, Japan. This 13 oz. red cast denim is the result of meticulous research and unchallenged expertise in denim craftsmanship. The fabric is woven on old shuttle looms, where the unique tension and yarn-spinning methods give it its distinctive texture.Snake Eyes features a complex marbled appearance, thanks to its irregular weft yarns and the inherent tension of the shuttle loom weaving process. As you wear and wash this denim, it reveals a dynamic red cast that deepens into a rich blue hue, alongside a striking marbling effect. This results in a fabric that not only evolves beautifully over time but also mimics the intricate textures seen in the finest vintage jeans.Key Features:Weight: 13 oz.Yarns: Irregular thickness, contributing to a complex marbled textureColour: Red cast, evolving into a rich blue with marbling and salt-and-pepper graininessComposition: 100% organic cottonSource: Shinya Mills in Kojima, JapanGritty Jackson - Snake Eye Selvage (13 oz.)Tuff Tony - Snake Eyes Selvage (13 oz.)Dry Ruby: 14.6 oz. (Kuroki)Dry Ruby is a gem in Nudie\u2019s denim line-up (pun intended.). Dyed with natural indigo, it\u2019s made by the esteemed Kuroki Mill in Okayama, Japan. Both the warp and weft are ring-spun to create irregular thickness, giving the fabric its distinct \u201cperfectly imperfect\u201d texture.As you wear and wash this denim, you\u2019ll witness a transformation. The irregular yarns start to pucker, and the indigo slowly fades to reveal a brilliant blue tone.Areas exposed to abrasion develop a beautiful, grainy salt-and-pepper effect, showcasing the craftsmanship of old shuttle looms. The denim evolves with a balanced combination of vertical streakiness and a crosshatch effect, creating a visually stunning contrast between the indigo and the texture.Key Features:Weight: 14.6 oz.Yarns: Irregular thickness for a distinct textureColour: Natural indigo-dyed, fading to a brilliant blue with grainy salt-and-pepper effectsSelvedge ID: Elegant all-whiteComposition: 100% organic cottonSource: Kuroki Mill in Okayama, JapanGritty Jackson - Dry Ruby (14.6 oz.)Dry Heavy Selvage: 17 oz. (Yoshiwa)Dry Heavy Selvage is the heaviest denim in Nudie\u2019s lineup, weighing in at a substantial 17 oz. It\u2019s woven by Yoshiwa in Okayama and stands as a testament to the pinnacle of Japanese craftsmanship.The fabric\u2019s distinct stiffness, coupled with notably slubby yarns, creates a highly visual and tactile experience. As you wear and wash it, Dry Heavy Selvage develops pronounced twill lines and a grainy surface, showcasing beautiful marbling and puckering effects that tell the story of its journey.Key Features:Weight: 17 oz.Yarns: Coarse, slubby texture replicating early 20th-century workwearColour: Deep pure indigo with undyed core, aging to show pronounced twill lines and marblingSelvedge ID: RedComposition: 100% organic cottonSource: Yoshiwa in Okayama, JapanSteady Eddie II - Dry Heavy (17 oz.)Fukuyama (Stretch) Selvage: 12.5 oz. (Kurabo)This 12.5 oz. orange-line selvedge is a stellar example of Japan\u2019s ability to blend tradition with innovation. Dipped 12 times in pure indigo and meticulously woven on vintage shuttle looms, this fabric may seem unassuming at first glance, but it\u2019s anything but ordinary.True to its historical roots, this denim features a rustic texture with long, irregular yarn slubs and a deep indigo tone. As the denim wears and ages, the slubs create unique vertical streakiness and a distinctive salt-and-pepper grain.What really sets the Fukuyama Selvage apart is the fact that it\u2019s made with stretch, a challenging addition to replicate in such rustic denim. Kurabo has masterfully spun stretch into this yarn, maintaining the denim\u2019s traditional aesthetics while offering modern comfort and flexibility.Key Features:Weight: 12.5 oz.Yarns: Long, irregular slubs contributing to a rustic textureColour: Deep pure indigo, aged to reveal white core highlights and vertical streakinessSelvedge ID: Orange-lineComposition: 99% organic cotton, 1% elastaneSource: Woven by Kurabo Mills on vintage shuttle looms in Fukuyama, JapanLean Dean - Fukuyama Selvage (Stretch)Find the Perfect Fit: Subscribe for More GuidesDiscovering the best Nudie jeans and their unique Japanese selvedge denims is just the beginning.

To make the most of our jeans, we need to make sure we\u2019rewearingthem right.We see that a lot of you have questions about how to style selvedge jeans, and it\u2019s time for us to answer these questions.The answers below are based on our understanding of foundational style rules, pulled from a wide range of sources, and our own personal tastes.Just a few of the style books in Bryan\u2019s libraryWe understand that, by offering style guidance, we\u2019re walking into a minefield.

They make friends easily in casual wardrobes, pairing effortlessly and stylishly with just about anything.However, not all jeans are built the same. As we fall headlong into the world of well-made selvedge, the denim gets heavier. They look heavy, and they fade like only heavy selvedge can. This gives them an inimitable wow factor, but it also limits their adaptability.It\u2019s our advice to pair like with like. As what you wear below the belt climbs in weight, so should what you wear above the belt.A breezy linen shirt or a delicate knit will pair awkwardly with heavy selvedge. Just so,a beefy winter-weight flannelorheavy selvedge denim jacketwill overwhelmlightweight pairs, making you look top-heavy.These sharp contrast fades demand something of substance above themIf you\u2019re new to selvedge and looking for a highly adaptable pair that can work with your existing wardrobe, a traditional indigo denim in the range of 12-15 oz. will probably be your best bet. As you start adding heavier shirts and jackets to your wardrobe, a heavier pair will become a must.The light linen shirt looks perfectly at home paired with these fully faded 13 oz. jeansIf you\u2019ve got a broad-ranging wardrobe of heavy and light pieces, you\u2019ll find outfits start to hang together when you group pieces in the same weight class. Pair like with like and you\u2019ll be on the right track.Covering the EssentialsIf you\u2019re starting from scratch, you need to start by covering the basics. For shirting, you\u2019ll needa quality tee,a heavy flannel, and (if you want to spiff things up),a white button-up.White Tee GuidesFind a High-Quality White Tee HereHeavy Flannel GuideThe Best Heavyweight FlannelsWhite Shirt GuideHow to Wear a White Shirt with DenimFAQ: Can Double Denim Be Stylish?Provided you\u2019re in a casual context, doubling up on your denim pieces can be exceptionally stylish. In fact, few pieces pair as well with a selvedge denim shirt or jacket as selvedge jeans. They cry out to be worn together.Double denim works best when we can introduce some contrast to break up the layersThough we\u2019re not big fans of tonal style (where all pieces in an outfit are identical or nearly identical colours), selvedge denim pieces lend themselves very well to tonal looks. For the desired effect, try to match the indigo tones (redcast with redcast, greencast with greencast, etc.).Without contrast of some kind, denim can look more like a uniform than an outfit. This might be exactly the look you\u2019re going for, but don\u2019t be surprised if people stop you on the street, not to compliment your outfit but, rather, to ask you to top up the tank and rotate the tires.We love these Lee pieces, but the outfit needs some contrast to workBest practice is to introduce some contrast to your outfits. Something as simple as a white tee worn over a pair of jeans and under an open jean jacket gives the dark colours something to bounce off of.Even subtle contrast between your jeans and jacket can liven up an outfitBest of all is some contrast between the shirt, jacket, and jeans. An unbeatable combination is a nicely faded or light-coloured jacket, darker selvedge jeans, and a simple cotton basic like a tee, henley, longsleeve, or sweatshirt. The dark jeans serve as a pedestal for the contrasting above-the-belt pieces. A surefire hit.Doubling Up on Great DenimNo denimhead\u2019s collection is complete until they can tick the three big boxes:selvedge jeans,denim shirts, andselvedge denim jackets.Selvedge MasterlistSee Our List of the Best Selvedge JeansDenim ShirtsFind a Top-Quality Raw Denim Shirt HereDenim JacketsGet Yourself a Well-Made Denim JacketFAQ: Should I Tuck My Shirt Into My Jeans?There\u2019s an easy-to-remember rule for this. When it comes to tucking shirts into jeans, low means no. If you\u2019re going to tuck, you\u2019ll need a pair with a higher rise for it to look right.Here\u2019s why: Even if you\u2019ve got a \u201cflat\u201d stomach, it isn\u2019t actually flat. Shortly below your navel, the stomach angles back towards the pubic bone. This angle becomes even more prominent when you have any padding around the middle.A higher rise lends itself far better to tucked-in looksTuck shirts into low-rise jeans and you\u2019ll end up looking softer in the middle than you areTuck a shirt into low-rise jeans and you\u2019ll end up highlighting this angle (and any padding you might have). When the jeans sit higher on the body, this angle is concealed behind the waistband. The waistband divides the body neatly in two, and both shirt and jeans fall straight down.Provided you\u2019ve got a higher-rise pair, tucking your shirt into your waistband can absolutely sharpen up selvedge-based looks. It\u2019s our advice to stick to lighter-weight shirts when tucking. If you want to stay in the heritage world, chambrays are an excellent choice.Ilya Sobtchak of Blackhorse Lane Ateliers with a chambray shirt styled to perfectionHeavy flannels and thick selvedge westerns are another matter. They\u2019re designed to be worn untucked. Tuck them in and you\u2019ll look like you\u2019re carrying a spare tire around your waist. If you want to experiment with tucked in looks, steer clear of flannel (it\u2019s just too casual to tuck). For denim, look for something as lightweight as possible.Perfect Shirts for TuckingIf you want to have tucking options, start with shirts that won\u2019t add to much padding around your waist.Chambray ShirtJake from Almost Vintage StyleGet a Chambray Shirt from The Rite StuffOxford ShirtBryan in a Proper Cloth OxfordBuy a Gitman Oxford at Lost & FoundDenim ShirtImage from Care of CarlRRL\u2019s Denim Shirt Looks Great Tucked InFAQ: Do I Need to Wear a Belt with Jeans?There is a perfectly reasonable argument to make for belts being unnecessary if the jeans fit properly. We\u2019ve seen plenty of great looks that feature shirts tucked into jeans and empty belt loops.Simon Crompton often pulls off beltless denim-based looksHere\u2019s the issue, though (perhaps you\u2019ll agree). When we leave belt loops unfilled, this draws attention to the waistband. Our eyes linger there, noticing the absence. The same thing happens with suspender buttons that are unused. They draw the eye and cock the head.It\u2019s our advice that, if you have belt loops or suspender buttons, use them. The look is somehow incomplete without them.If tucking in, the belt should be at least roughly the same shade as your footwear, but this is less important when the belt is completely covered by the tails of your shirt.Especially when tucking, pair a thinner belt with higher-rise pairsWhen picking a belt, a good general rule is that the higher the waistband, the thinner your belt should be. A high rise pair with a thick belt and chunky buckle will make you look like Santa Claus.Great Denim Deserves an Equally Great BeltIt\u2019s our advice to have at least two belts: one for lower-rise pairs and a thinner, subtler one for tucked in looks.

You might even be able to get away with faded pairs, provided they\u2019re combined with smart pieces.We welcome this development, and we have been amazed at some of the smart casual looks that denimheads have created that bridge the worlds of traditional and rugged menswear.We have experimented with this ourselves, exploring how selvedge denim can be spiffed up without losing any of its essential character.There are a few dos and don\u2019ts that we\u2019ll touch on here:First of all, spiffed-up selvedge means tucked-in shirts. We\u2019re all for loose shirttails in casual looks, but, in any kind of business or semi-formal setting, untucked dress shirts look sloppy and even slovenly.This means that, if we\u2019re going to spiff up our selvedge, we need to start with a higher-rise pair that lends itself easily to tucked-in looks.Vests not only add texture to outfits. They also keep the tie from falling into your soupFor a jacket, go with a stand-alone blazer or sports jacket (preferably something with noteworthy texture). Do not under any circumstances split up a worsted wool suit, substituting jeans for the matching worsted wool trousers. The look is neither one thing nor the other.Jason Jules uses selvedge in ensembles dripping with contrast and textureEspecially in the cooler months, a shawl-collar cardigan can turn rugged combinations into smart casual looks in a moment, especially if the footwear is on the dressier side. Cozy knits, and especially turtlenecks, are a smarter alternative to flannel in the fall and winter. If you want to smarten the look further, add a blazer or a sports coat.Smart casual look styled by Nick WoosterWhen dressing up selvedge, boots work, but you\u2019ll find the outfit hanging together nicely if you add slightly more refined footwear.

Nothing seems to complete selvedge-based looks quite as well as well-made boots.The most popular style by a wide margin is the six-inch lace-up work boot, withRed Wing\u2019s Iron Rangerbeing a perennial scene favourite.When it comes to well-made boots, there are dozens of makers to choose from, so before you jump into anything, it\u2019s a good idea to familiarise yourself with some of the pairs available at your price point. The differences are often subtle but, for some boot lovers, absolutely critical.For more aggressive heritage-based looks,the engineer boothas no equal. It was the bedrock of the countercultural look (worn so well by Marlon Brando inThe Wild One) that caught fire and turned jeans and biker jackets into style essentials in the early \u201850s.The look works as well on the street today as it did on the silver screen in 1953.The8-inch crepe-soled moc-toe boot(once again made by Red Wing) was a foundational piece for Japanese denim collectors, who started pairing the boot with faded Levi\u2019s 501s in the 1970s. Comfortable and stylish, it pairs as stylishly with jeans (especially faded ones) as ever.For more polished looks, oxfords can do the trick, but nothing seems to work as well as penny loafers. Less formal than lace-ups, they pair easily and naturally with selvedge jeans, chinos, and even shorts. Once you\u2019ve got a pair, you\u2019ll quickly see just how essential they are.Even these inexpensive penny loafers offer a nice change from heavy bootsIf you prefer athletic footwear, the world of sneaker obsession frequently overlaps with the world of selvedge.To pair well with your top-shelf selvedge, sneakers should be clean and slightly elevated.

On the larger man, a pair of slim straights might look painted on. A skinnier man might look like he\u2019s swimming in that same pair.(Left) Ethan Newton and Kenji Cheung of Bryceland\u2019s understand how to suit their shapesSimilarly, if you tend to reach for oversized sweatshirts and hoodies, it\u2019s logical to stick with generous fits below the belt, and if you like your shirts to fit tight, your jeans should fit in the same way. Your silhouette should be balanced.There\u2019s not one cut that fits all body types and styles. Exceptionally stylish selvedge-based looks do, however, have two things in common: they flatter the wearer, highlighting their best features; and they are coherent, speaking an identical or at least compatible style language.Slim straights like these Iron Heart 666S work very well for middle-of-the-road body typesThe jeans you pick should be a perfect fit both for your body and the pieces you plan to wear with the pair. For the average man with average tastes, the slim straight will usually be the best fit. It will work with just about any untucked looks, and it will pair nicely with a wide range of footwear.More generously cut, higher-rise pairs (often based on fits from the late \u201840s or early \u201850s) will be a great choice for those who want to lean into heritage menswear, and the combination of wider legs and higher waistbands flatter a broader range of body types (including broad ones).Full Count\u2019s generously cut 0105 photographed by Clutch Caf\u00e9It\u2019s our advice to steer clear of the extremes.

DenimFull Count S0105Image fromClutch Caf\u00e9Loose-Fitting 1940\u2019s WWII-era JeansFAQ: Should I Cuff My Jeans, or Hem Them?Those dipping their toe into the selvedge pool are often perplexed by the amount of cuffed selvedge they see in the scene.The rolled cuffs are a stylistic choice, providing a pleasing visual break between our jeans and our footwear that, as an added bonus, shows off the selvedge ID, which advertises our love for great jeans.The double roll works very well for both lightweight pairs like this one and heavy selvedge (Image by Jake from Almost Vintage Style)If you\u2019re not fond of the look of cuffed selvedge, the practice is entirely optional. Most retailers offer some kind of hemming service, and you can often order your pair hemmed to your usual length. Make sure to ask the retailer about how much shrink you can expect with your pair.If you\u2019re new to selvedge and unsure about whether you want to cuff or not, leave yourself at least a few inches to play with when ordering. When you get them home, experiment with different cuffing techniques. Compare how the jeans look when they are cuffed to how they look when the denim is rolled inside the jeans.The single roll shows off not just your selvedge ID but also your chain stitched hemWhether you are cuffing or not, best practice is to talk to your retailer about your desired inseam length, cuff size, etc. If they don\u2019t offer hemming services, consider waiting to have them hemmed until after you\u2019ve washed them a few times.Whether they are sanforized, one-washed, or unsanforized, you never know exactly how much your pair will shrink until after you\u2019ve washed them.Try adding an extra roll so that the cuff sits just above your ankleLeave around 1.5 to 2 inches per roll. Remember that it\u2019s always better to have a little too much than not enough. Long pairs can be rolled up or down. Short ones will likely never get worn.Cuffing and Caring for Your SelvedgeThere might be a right way and a wrong way to wash your jeans, but, when it comes to cuffing, there are a lot of options to consider.How to Cuff Your Jeans (Video)Thomas Shows You No Less Than 8 Ways to Cuff Your JeansHow to Wash Raw Denim JeansLearn Thomas\u2019 Tips for How to Wash Raw DenimFAQ: Who Makes the Most Stylish Selvedge Jeans?Just as with cuts, there is no answer to this question that will suit everybody. Whether you are looking for your first or your fiftieth pair of selvedge, it\u2019s our advice to look far and wide for that perfect pair.Selvedge is an investment, and you should only slap your plastic on the counter when you\u2019re sure that you\u2019re getting your money\u2019s worth.There\u2019s no guarantee that the top-shelf brands will look better on you than entry-level brands will.There\u2019s significant value for money with each rung of the price ladder you climb, but this value has more to do with how the denim is woven and how the pairs are constructed than how stylish they are.The pair on the left costs more, but you might prefer the pair on the rightWe have our favourite brands that we frequently recommend here on Denimhunters, but it\u2019s good practice not to get too hung up on a particular brand\u2019s output. Even if you feel a particular brand is speaking directly to you, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019re not the only ones speaking your precise style language.The most stylish characters in this scene tend to build outfits based on particular moods and moments. Rather than recreating a particular brand\u2019s catalogue shots, they assemble looks from disparate places and times. The result is a look that is entirely their own.The best pairs for you will be the ones that you wear the most. The more you wear them, the more stylish and adaptable they will become.

      "title": "Dressing Up Selvedge: Three White Shirts to Pair with Denim",
      "body": "Looking to Elevate Your Selvedge Style? Here\u2019s How To Wear a White Shirt with Raw DenimThe worlds of blue-collar and white-collar style flow in very different channels. At times, these channels intersect, and occasionally they run parallel to each other. When, for instance, the classic menswear enthusiast seeks the best-possible pair of jeans for casual looks, they might find themselves drawn into the world of well-made selvedge.In the same way, the rugged menswear enthusiast who either wants or needs to present a more polished appearance can look to the world of classic menswear for guidance and inspiration.If we are going to borrow just one piece from the classic menswear cannon, let it be the button-up shirt. Paired with selvedge,the classic business shirt,the button-down ivy, orthe breezy linencan transform blue-collar styles into hybrid business-casual styles in a hurry.The advice I\u2019ve been able to find on dressing up denim seems to always approach the subject from the perspective of the typical well-dressed man (thinkGQorEsquire) in search of more casual looks. They treat the jeans themselves as an afterthought, as something that can pull classic white-collar pieces in more casual directions.Since selvedge is central to our notions of style, we\u2019ve approached the subject from the opposite direction. We know that you\u2019ve put a great amount of thought into your jeans, and we\u2019re going to look at a few ways we can apply a coat of polish to selvedge-based looks, beginning with our not-so-secret weapon.Your Not-So-Secret Weapon: The White Button-Up ShirtLike a great pair of selvedge, the white button-up shirt has few equals in terms of versatility. Depending on what you pair it with, it is comfortable everywhere from the pub to the country club, rubbing elbows and sipping cocktails with every skin or fabric tone. This makes it the ideal blank canvas for those who want to experiment with style elevation.However, not just any white shirt will do. The fit has to be dialled in, and the details (collar, placket, and cuff style) have to work together with the pieces you\u2019re pairing it with. The fabric has to be right, and it simply has to be spotless\u2013it doesn\u2019t have tobenew, but it does have tolooknew.It\u2019s got to look newSet in stains are nearly impossible to removeIf your only white button-up shirts were purchased in a hurry for a special event of some kind, and if they\u2019ve been pulled out of the closet for every subsequent special occasion, it\u2019s probably time for a new dance partner.Is there a yellow ring around the collar? Are the armpits a different colour than the rest of the shirt? Are the elbows threadbare? Are the cuffs frayed?If you\u2019ve answeredyesto any of these questions, bin that old shirt and start looking for a replacement. A bleach bath can help in some cases, but once the stains are set into the fabric, no amount of bleaching will get them out.Unless you\u2019ve invested enough in the shirt to make collar or cuff replacement worth your while, it\u2019ll be best to start fresh with a crisp white shirt in one of the styles we recommend below.Wear Proper Selvedge and Proper ClothBefore we turn to our shirt recommendations, a quick word on some fundamentals for dressing up denim. First, we need to start with the right pair.If you\u2019re new to the world of quality selvedge denim, ourSelvedge Masterlistis an excellent starting point. We\u2019ll have some more specific recommendations below.We\u2019re big fans of heavy selvedge, but for dressed up looks, something in the middleweight range will be best. The fabric should move with you without putting up much of a fight. Most importantly, it should look comfortable, even if it is brand new.Like the shirts, your jeans should also be clean. For more polished looks (anything that features a white button-up shirt qualifies), new selvedge will be best. While we will never tire of encouraging denim lovers to fade their jeans thoroughly, this is one case where we can lay that advice to one side. Keep something crisp and dark in reserve.Finally, keep it slim and simple. Slim straights or tapered fits are best, and the classic five-pocket design is your best option here. Wide legs and vintage details like cinch backs and exposed rivets might elevate your vintage style, but they\u2019ll gel uneasily with the shirts we\u2019ve recommended below.Business, Rugged or Casual?We\u2019re recommending three different shirt styles:the classic business shirt,the button-down ivy, andthe breezy linen. Which of these will be right for you will depend on which of the looks we\u2019ve assembled below catch your eye and which mesh with your personal style.I want to thank the good people at Proper Cloth who sent me the three white shirts I\u2019ve used for this article. I\u2019ve ordered from them before, and they have my measurements on file. It takes all the guesswork out of ordering shirts. I just pick the fabric and select the appropriate options, tweaking the fit here and there depending on my desired style.They have an almost impossibly broad selection of fabrics. For these three shirts, I sorted through nearly 50 white fabrics, picking what I felt were the best ones for the style of shirt I was trying to create. I\u2019ve included links to each of the fabrics I picked, but I encourage you to explore theirfull range of shirting fabrics.The Classic Business ShirtWe\u2019re leading off with the dressiest shirt in the bunch, and there\u2019s no way around this one. The classic business shirt has to be tucked in. No matter how you try to dress it up, an untucked business shirt looks sloppy.The Proper Cloth:Thomas Mason White Organic BroadclothStraight point collarLong one button cuffStandard front placketSplit yokeRounded hemStandard buttonsNo chest pocketsBecause we\u2019re tucking our shirts in, we need jeans with at least a medium rise. Tucking shirts into low-rising trousers elongates the torso, making the legs appear comically short.Even if you\u2019re a long-legged fellow (like me), this won\u2019t be a flattering look. Low-rising denim will be fine with the untucked looks we\u2019ll cover below.Top 3 Selvedge Jeans with Mid-High Rise$310Iron Heart 888S-142Buy from Iron Heart$240Tellason ElginBuy from Heddels$265Freewheelers 661XXBuy from CorlectionFor tucked in looks, I like to wear a belt, even if I don\u2019t need one. I hate the look of empty belt loops, and I have a decent range of belts to pick from, which allows me to coordinate my belt with my footwear. Slimmer belts with buckles on the subtle side work best. If all you\u2019ve got is two-prong monsters as thick as fan belts, it might be best to go unbelted.If you\u2019ve got a few ties that you\u2019d like to bring into active service, this shirt style will be the best choice for you. Indeed, this style of shirt should always be worn with a tie (it seems somehow incomplete without one). If you prefer open-throated looks, the ivy shirt below will be a better choice.For a smashing business casual look, pair the classic business shirt with a vest. Choose a tie that works with both the vest and the jeans.I\u2019ve gone with a striking plaid vest I picked up in Tokyo at The Flat Head boutique, a pair of16 oz. Realign Tapered Yoshis, and a two-toned brown tie that serves as a nice counterpoint to the vest\u2019s complex pattern. The classic four-in-hand tie knot I\u2019ve used is the only one you need to know.If you have a blazer or a sports jacket, you can throw this in the mix. Some jackets that are part of matching suits can pass for sports jackets, but not all.Donotuse a worsted wool suit jacket that is clearly meant to be the upper half of a business suit. Stick with jackets made from rough tweed, corduroy, or linen. They\u2019ll all harmonise nicely with selvedge.Finally, try wearing the shirt and tie under double-denim looks. Bryan Tyree Henry did this exceptionally well inBullet Train, pairing a Uniqlo Type II and matching jeans (probably also Uniqlo) with a white dress shirt and a tie.As with Henry\u2019s look, the denim pieces should be of a similar or identical cast. They should also be faded (if at all) to a similar degree.Truth be told, this look was the inspiration for this article. I tried it myself. I expected it to work, but I wasn\u2019t prepared for how sharp the combination would look.It fuses the worlds of rugged and the classic menswear with ease, and it gets a ton of attention on the street.The key is the tie, which should connect in some way to the rest of the outfit. Henry\u2019s tie was a near-perfect match with the stitching on his Type II, and I\u2019ve tried to do the same here.I\u2019m wearing a Zegna tie with subtle yellow stripes that match nicely with the stitching on my Real McCoy\u2019s Type III. Choose a tie that references your denim pieces in this way and you can\u2019t go wrong.The Button-Down IvyI\u2019ve always avoided the button-down oxford\u2013mostly because of its preppy associations. When I was researching formy book, though, I began to see the worlds of prep and ivy (and the button-down oxford) through new eyes.The Proper Cloth:Thomas Mason White Oxford ClothSoft ivy button down collarSoft long one button cuffSoft front placketSplit yokeRounded hemStandard buttonsNo chest pocketsIncorporating denim (selvedge of course), leather varsity jackets, and sweatshirts, ivy bridged the worlds of workwear, sportswear, and classic menswear, creating a hybrid style that has remained current for the better part of a century.What\u2019s more, made-to-fade (or bleed) madras and the look\u2019s privileging of well-worn pieces over brand new ones opened the door to slower approaches to style. We owe more to ivy than you might think.What I saw in books likeTake Ivyand Jason Jules\u2019sBlack Ivywas that the worlds of rugged and ivy style draw towards each other at the base. Like rugged style, ivy was, for those who first practised it, a radical reinterpretation of men\u2019s fashion.Top 3 Ivy-Ready Selvedge Jeans$275Orslow 107 Ivy FitBuy from Blue in Green$198SDA D1826 New IvyBuy from Corlection$265Ruttloff C2-23 ChinoBuy from RuttloffThe button-down oxford with its gracefully rolled collar was the backbone of the casual style, and, having added one to my wardrobe, I can see why. Of all the button-up shirts, it is by far the most adaptable.It can be worn tucked or untucked, with a tie or without, with a jacket or without, buttoned up to the top or open at the throat, and it is heavy enough to pair with selvedge of just about any weight.To lean into its roots, pair the oxford with pieces that share an ivy-league pedigree.I\u2019ve gone with aDehen1920 x James Dantvarsity jacket, a throw-back piece that makes almost as many appearances in ivy style manuals as the button-down oxford.Finished off with a pair of custom jeans from Ruttloff, the outfit looks ready to hit the quad (even if my school days are long, long behind me).The shirt\u2019s not fussy. It plays exceptionally well with others, pairing effortlessly with complementary pieces like sports jackets and cardigans. At the same time, unlike the classic business shirt, it shines as a solo performer.My favourite way to wear it is tucked into these green denim chinos from Ruttloff. I bought the chinos a few years ago, and I\u2019ve been struggling to find an outfit that does them justice.The button-down oxford did the trick, and the stellar combination means that both the chinos and the shirt will see regular action.The Breezy LinenEven in northern climes, the summer sun makes heavy denim shirts and jackets impractical. If you still want to wear long-sleeved collared shirts, even when the temperatures are soaring, the linen shirt is indispensable. It\u2019s a summer classic with few equals in terms of its ability to spruce up our hot-weather wardrobes.The Proper Cloth:Baird McNutt White Irish LinenDetails: Franklin spread collarSoft long one button cuffNo placketSplit yokeRounded hemStandard buttonsNo chest pocketsIt will work with denim of just about any colour and weight, but it\u2019s most in its element with lightweight and thoroughly faded selvedge.On a sunny day or a sweltering evening, reach for your favourite pair and throw the breezy linen shirt over your shoulders. Roll the cuffs of both the jeans and the shirt, and slip into some slip-ons. Job done.Top 3 Lightweight Selvedge Jeans$195Sugar Cane 2009Buy from Franklin & Poe\u20ac360Benzak BDD 710NBuy from Benzak$189Stevenson Big SurBuy fromFranklin & PoeLike flannel and denim, linen is ideal for those who hate ironing their shirts, and it\u2019s not just that linen doesn\u2019tneedto be ironed. It actually looks better when wrinkled.Simply launder it and hang it up and wear it straight off the hanger. Alternatively, you can roll it into a ball before you throw it on for that extra rumpled look.I\u2019ve paired mine here with my oldest pair of raw denim\u2013a pair of non-selvedge Nudies in their now-defunct Average Joe fit.Well into their second decade, the jeans don\u2019t see as much action as they once did, but on hot days they, like the linen shirt, are an excellent no-fuss option.Linen and NudiesLinen and N&FThe shirt worked best, though, with my 13 oz. pair of Naked & Famous. Purchased not long after the Nudies, they saw some rough usage when I was backpacking across Europe.I\u2019ve repaired them myself, and the heavy white thread and the rough Irish linen joined up like long lost friends when I put them together.Now It\u2019s Your TurnWe\u2019d love to see how you\u2019ve worked white button-up shirts into your selvedge looks.

These Pairs Should Be at the Top of Your List!About once a year, I clean out my closet. I unfold all my jeans and lay them on top of each other. The last time I did this, I noticed a theme. The denims and details were all very different, but the fits (especially the ones I\u2019ve worn the most) were nearly all the same\u2014all slim with a low or medium rise.There are very good reasons for this. Slim straights sit comfortably between wider-legged and skinnier fits, which makes them highly trend-resistant. Fashion might be pulling the crowd towards one end of the spectrum or the other, but slim-fitting pairs coast through the middle zone. They never go out of style, and they look great with just about everything.Of course, your body shape plays into this. What brands call a slim fit will be skin tight for some and baggy for others. All off-the-rack pairs have been designed for a specific range of body shapes. If you fall outside of that range, you might need to look at wider or narrower fits to get the desired effect.Not sure which fit fits you best? Start your hunt withour jeans fit guide.The pairs below (many of which we own ourselves) are the absolute cream of the slim-fitting crop. If you\u2019re in the market for a new pair and want something trend-resistant and primed for fades, this list is the absolute best place to start.Because slim-fitting jeans are most comfortable in lighter denims, we\u2019ve opted for middleweight denims throughout this list. If you prefer heavier denims, some of the pairs featured below will be available in considerably heavier versions.Iron Heart 777-142 (14 oz.)Iron Heart\u2019s slim-tapered cut (one of the brand\u2019s most popular fits) charts a comfortable middle course between their super-slim 555 cut and their straight 634 cut. Following the line of the leg, they taper as they fall towards the cuff, but not so much that they hug the ankle.Bryan IHxSJF-777-142 jeans, new vs. some 8 months of wearThe 14 oz. selvedge is the lightest denim in Iron Heart\u2019s line-up. It\u2019s remarkably comfortable, and, with daily wear, you can expect to see your pair fade quite quickly. You don\u2019t need to work construction or ride motorcycles to bring the absolute best out of this denim.This denim produces beautiful contrasts, but if you want those thick combs and whiskers, head up the scale with the brand\u2019s signature21 oz. selvedgeor their superheavyweightXHS.GET A PAIR OF IRON HEART 777 JEANS HERETellason John Graham MellorProudly made in San Francisco from Japanese denim, Tellason\u2019s slim straight fit, John Graham Mellor, borrows the name of the lead singer of the Clash (better known by his stage name of Joe Strummer).The 16.5 oz. selvedge was milled for the brand by Kaihara Mills in Japan. Tellason once used America\u2019s Cone Mills denim for their pairs, but they were forced to look across the Pacific when the legendary mill, who supplied Levi\u2019s during their most iconic years, closed its doors for good.Fit pics fromGarmentoryThe no-nonsense pair have been behind some legendary fades over the years. Slim through the thighs and around the knees, you can expect them to produce beautiful whiskers and combs if pushed hard enough.BUY A PAIR OF SLIM FIT TELLASON JEANS HERESamurai S0511XXII Otokogi (15 oz.)In the wide, wide world of Samurai fits, one slim-fitting pair rules them all.

Kiwami Selvedgeis a natural choice, but for the combination of fades and comfort, the one-washed 15 oz.

The result was their RARE selvedge, which remained one of Japan\u2019s best-kept secrets until faders in the West started to get wind of it.Bryan\u2019s worn-in pair of Rare 009The unsanforized denim can be found in two of the brand\u2019s signature fits: the generously cut 008 and the slim-fitting 009.Dripping with details like deerskin-backed rivets and buttons, wrench-proof construction to counteract leg twist, and an indigo-dyed patch, RARE pairs are marvels of engineering and some of the best bang-for-buck pairs on the market.For newcomers, there\u2019s no better starter pair. Fast-fading and impeccably cut, the Rare 009 can turn rookies into full-fledged enthusiasts in a heartbeat. Be aware, though, that the unsanforized denim will shrink 5-10% when introduced to water.

As the pair fades, the brown weft yarns begin to fleck the surface. The combination of indigo and brown leads to dirty fades that demand attention.The 2105 is quite slim through the thighs and the top block, so, for those with some meat on their bones, you\u2019ll want to check the hip and thigh measurements carefully. For those unfamiliar with unsanforized denim, stick with the one-wash version.PICK UP A PAIR OF STRIKE GOLDS AT REDCASTBenzak B-01 (15.5 oz.)The least expensive pair on this list, this pair would be a bargain at just about any price.

The result is a clearly contemporary pair with exceptionally clean finishing and sparkling details. The beautiful indigo arcuates are nearly invisible, but they will become more apparent as the pair fades.The sanforized denim (called Deadstock Blue) is a reproduction of a roll of deadstock selvedge found languishing on a shelf somewhere in the Collect Mills warehouse.

This changed when I finally bit the bullet and got a pair of generously cut, high-rise selvedge jeans fromRuttloff.Suddenly, I was able to pair my jeans with dressier shirts, whichonlylook right when tucked into high waistbands. But even with untucked looks, the pair was a revelation.All of those shorter shirts that had languished at the back of my closet suddenly made perfect sense.Short tees finally covered my belt, and I was finally able to unbutton the bottom button on all my vests.Why High-Rise Jeans Make Sense for Most Body TypesLarger men have long understood the slimming properties of higher-rise pairs, but their benefits are not reserved for the portly.The higher waistband neatly bisects the body into highly pleasing proportions, highlighting long and slim legs and shortening long torsos.Jake aka @almostvintagestylecould be the poster boy for the high-rise lookIf, like me, you\u2019ve found something that works for you in lower-rise pairs and stuck with it, you might find one of the pairs below a revelation.At the very least, it\u2019ll add a little bit of variety to your selvedge collection.Be aware that, because higher-rise pairs sit higher on the hips, this may affect your waist size.

With immaculate craftsmanship and breathtaking denims, Warehouse pairs can be found in the collections of discerning denimheads worldwide.Warehouse 1001XX, casually styled byLost & FoundThe 1001XX is a stitch-perfect reproduction of the Levi\u2019s 501 produced shortly after the end of WWII. The Banner Denim is a result of a literally microscopic analysis of a deadstock Levi\u2019s banner from the period. It\u2019s as close as you can come to the real thing without a time machine.A pair of these took home the bronze medal in Year Three of the Indigo Invitational, and they might be the best combination of vintage and contrast fading that we\u2019ve ever seen in the competition. Why we don\u2019t see more competitors wearing this brand is an enduring mystery.BUY THE WAREHOUSE 1001XX JEANS HERETCB \u201850s Regular Straight (13.5 oz.)One of the many TCB pairs that retailers can\u2019t keep on their shelves, TCB\u2019s generously cut \u201850s Regular Straight is the near-perfect three-way collision of comfort, style, and value. A bargain at any price, they fly out the door in a hurry everywhere they\u2019re stocked.These fit pics of the TCB \u201950s jeans are fromWithered FigThe unfussy lightweight selvedge is designed to be used and abused.

Stylish and highly adaptable, the cut flatters a wide range of body shapes. For bigger men, the ample top block and generously cut thighs will be a perfect mixture of style and comfort.The 19 oz. \u2018lefty\u2019 denim is a fade beast\u2014here\u2019sJames aka @luvthefades\u2019Type III jacketIron Heart offers the 888 in denim ranging from 14 oz. to 25 oz. Our favourite, the 19 oz. Left Hand Twill, is smack dab in the middle of this range. Thanks to its extremely tight weave, you can expect some leg twist as the pair ages\u2014particularly in the right leg.GET YOUR HIGH-RISE 888 IRON HEARTS HEREIndigofera Kain (14 oz.)This brand new fit from Sweden\u2019s hometown heroes features a sky-high rise and a graceful straight leg that cries out to be paired with slip-on boots. Though it\u2019s not the widest leg in the Indigofera line-up (that\u2019d be the Kirk), it\u2019s our favourite among their higher-rise offerings.The neppy selvedge (milled in Japan, of course) is absolutely dripping with texture. Pair it with a tucked in tee for a classic 1950s vibe.Fit pics of the Kain fromSecond SunriseThe denim is sanforized but unwashed. Wear them for at least a few months before washing them in cold water. They should return to the size they were when you bought them.GET INDIGOFERA\u2019S NEW KAIN JEANS HEREFull Count 0105 (13.7 oz.)One of the fits that made Full Count\u2019s name synonymous with Japanese denim in the \u201890s, the 0105 was updated recently to give the wearer more room in the seat and thighs. The fit, renamed the 1953 Cut, is everything a generously cut high-rise pair should be.The arcuates also disappeared in the update, which might not tickle your fancy if you\u2019re a fan of embellished back pockets. For our money, though, the pared-down pairs are an improvement over the original.The selvedge denim, woven in Japan, is made with Zimbabwe cotton. The lightweight denim is incredibly comfortable, but don\u2019t let its softness fool you. It\u2019s got a heart of iron and can definitely go the distance.BUY THE FULL COUNT 0105 JEANS HEREThe Guy Who Built This Site Has Launched a Brand!It\u2019s called Weirloom, and the newWL#1 Regular Fitjeans are complete with a leather patch, branded buttons, and a new woven label.Learn more and buy a pair here.Freenote Modesto (16 oz.)The Modesto is a very recent addition for Freenote, and we think they\u2019ve knocked this high-rise fit out of the park. Made in the United States from Japanese selvedge, the pair is an immaculate fusion of East and West.Full-sized cuff is optionalThe acorn-shaped back pockets definitely pull this pair decidedly towards the West. Stylish, vintage-inspired details like this are what helped put Freenote on the map, and they remain a top choice for those looking to stand out from the pack.The 16 oz. selvedge has a slight green cast to it which will become more apparent as the jeans age. They produced this pair in extremely limited quantities, but we\u2019re hoping it will become a full-fledged member of the Freenote family.GET THE FREENOTE MODESTO JEANS HEREMister Freedom Californian Lot 64 (13 oz.)Brought to you by the king of Southwest Americana, Christophe Loiron, the Californian Lot 64 are the result of the longstanding partnership between Japan\u2019s Sugar Cane and California\u2019s Mister Freedom.With just a touch of taper, the jeans fall gracefully from waist down to the cuffs. With the brand\u2019s trademark M\u2019s on the pockets and a cowhide patch on the right pocket, they look as good going as they do coming.The denim, a blend of 70% cotton and 30% sugarcane fibres, features a reddish cast and a neppy face. Exceptionally hairy, it\u2019s a treat for both the hands and the eyes.GET A PAIR OF MISTER FREEDOM JEANS HEREDenime Lot 220XX 1947 Model (14.5 oz.)The second-oldest member of the Osaka Five, Denime started producing faithful reproductions of vintage Levi\u2019s pairs in the late \u201880s. The swelling enthusiasm for these reproductions helped but Japanese denim on the map in the \u201890s and \u201800s.Warehouse and Co. now handle production for some of Denime\u2019s most iconic products (including the 220XX), so this pair is made from a version of Warehouse\u2019s iconic Banner Denim. The chief difference is the brown-tinted weft, which some prefer to white-wefted original.A brilliant pair with an unimpeachable pedigree, a pair of these will get you deep nods of appreciation in the right circles.PICK UP DENIME\u2019S 220XX 1947 JEANS HERESugar Cane 1946 Model (13.5 oz.)Another brilliant example of a Japanese brand going the extra mile to produce a truly authentic original, Sugar Cane\u2019s 1946 model is the pet project of the brand\u2019s director, Yuichi Fukutomi\u2014an outpouring of his passion for vintage Americana.They released two models, the 1943 and the 1946. The one we\u2019ve featured here is the 1946, which reproduces some of the details from when Levi\u2019s were first freed from the limitations imposed on them during wartime. The pair is a little rough around the edges, but this is the point.We love pairs that tell a great story, and this one tells a story of the resilience of American manufacturing in the years immediately after WWII.GET A PAIR OF SUGAR CANE 1946 JEANS HEREStudio D\u2019Artisan SD-909 G3 (14 oz.)Another brown-wefted beauty from an Osaka Five brand, Studio D\u2019Artisan\u2019s SD-909 features denim woven on the Toyoda G3 loom, the first selvedge loom produced in Japan. Only one mill in Japan still has operational Toyoda G3s, so this denim is as rare as it is beautiful.Thanks to its strong taper from the knee down, the SD-909 will be a great choice for those who want a high rise and a generous top block and thighs but don\u2019t want to be swimming in wide cuffs. An excellent mixture of modern and traditional.The denim is unsanforized and unwashed, so expect at least a full size of shrinkage with this pair. Read the measurement chart carefully. Like all unsanforized denims, we recommend that you soak the pair before wearing them.BUY THE HIGH-RISE SD-909 G3 JEANS HEREBuzz Rickson\u2019s WWII Waist Overalls (13.6 oz.)Best known for their meticulous reproductions of Army, Navy, and Airforce classics, Buzz Rickson\u2019s can go toe to toe with selvedge brands\u2014particularly when it comes to perfectly authentic period pieces.Another pair based on the jeans produced during WWII, when the American government imposed strict material-saving restrictions on manufacturers, the WWII Waist Overalls feature period-correct details like iron rivets (instead of the usual copper) and a rivetless coin pocket.There is some discrepancy between the tagged waist size and the waist measurements, so don\u2019t order your usual size without first checking the measurements extremely carefully.PICK UP A PAIR OF BUZZ RICKSON\u2019S JEANS HEREComplete the Kit with a Tee and Some BootsHigh-rise pairs can radically transform your style, but this doesn\u2019t mean you need an entirely new wardrobe.

This guide provides an overview of the entire process.Best Places to Buy Well-Made MenswearWhether you\u2019re looking for a pair of selvedge jeans, a denim jacket, a loopwheeled T-shirt, or anything that is made slowly and purposefully, start your search with these brands and retailers:Support us when you shop:We earn a small commissionwhen you buy from these merchants.Phase #1: ExplorationThe first phase of buying raw denim usually starts with you somehow wanting a pair of those dark blue jeans. Maybe a friend has told you about them or maybe you saw them in a store.Whatever the reason, before you act on an impulse, do some research. Start online (with a guide like this one). Ask your friends. Go back to your local denim store.Depending on how much time and effort you want to dedicate to this phase, you\u2019ll probably spend anything from a couple hours to several months researching.What I\u2019d like you to focus your research on is this:BudgetStyleBrandsLet\u2019s take a quick look at each of them.What\u2019s Your Budget?You can get raw denim jeans that cost \u20ac400 or more. Others cost you \u20ac50 or less. And there\u2019s something at every price point in between.What you need to decide before you move on is how much you\u2019re willing to spend. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re looking a new car or planning your next holiday. If you\u2019re serious about it, you need to decide how much you can and will spend.No matter what your budget is, follow the \u2018less is more\u2019 principle.Rather than of buying four pairs of \u20ac50-jeans, consider buying one \u20ac200-pair.Looking for the Biggest Bang for Your Buck?Great selvedge isn\u2019t necessarily expensive. If you\u2019re looking for big value for your money, start here:Sugar Cane JeansGet Sugar Cane jeans hereJapan Blue JeansBuy Japan Blue jeans hereTCB JeansBuy TCB jeans hereThose who dive into the raw denim scene with both feet often latch onto the first or second entry-level brand they try. A few months later, you three or four pairs of inexpensive raws (sometimes more than this). Then, when you discover the deeper levels of the scene (and there are always deeper levels), you suffer from buyer\u2019s remorse.Better to start with one pair at the upper end of your budget. Wear that pair well. Embrace the full raw experience. While your jeans are fading, continue exploring.Chances are you\u2019ll be happier with the pricier pair, simply because they\u2019ll be more valuable to you.What\u2019s Your Style?One way to do that is to think about who your favourite idol is. Who did you idolise growing up, who do you idolise today? It could be a musician, a fictive character in a movie, even a family member or a friend?Do you have your idol in mind? Good, which jeans is he or she wearing? How do they fit? Which colour are they? What about the details? Now picture yourself in those jeans. Still good? Keep that in mind as you go through the next phases.What\u2019s Your Brand?Once you know your budget and you\u2019ve daydreamed about rocking the hell out of those jeans your idols wears, think about what brand(s) you\u2019d like the jeans to be.In the end, no matter how much time you spend on phase #1, you\u2019ll eventually get to phase #2, which is when you start making concrete decisions based on the research you\u2019ve done.Our Favourite Japanese Selvedge JeansThe list of our favourite Japanese selvedge jeans is long, but at the very top of it, you\u2019ll find these three.Straight fitIron Heart 634SBuy the 634S from Iron HeartTapered fitOni 622ZR-KABEGBuy the 622ZR from RedcastSlim fitSamurai S710XX (15 oz.)Buy Samurai at Blue in GreenPhase #2: Decision-MakingIn the second phase, you\u2019re getting much closer to the moment when you\u2019ll put down your money on a pair of jeans. In this phase, I\u2019d like you to consider the following:FitFabricLengthLet me share the key arguments of each step.How Would You Like the Jeans to Fit?A good fit is essential to get jeans you\u2019ll be happy with. The fit is determined by two attributes: the shape of the leg and the rise.The shape of the leg is what gives you the different fits. Generally, you can choose between skinny, slim, straight, carrot, loose and bootcut. The fit is determined by measurements at the thigh, the knee, and the leg opening.A classic straight fit that\u2019s possibly on the slimmer side of the curve, the Clint from Indigofera.The rise is the distance from the top of the waistband to the crotch joint. Unlike trousers and slacks, the back rise of jeans is curved. The rise is important because it determines where the jeans sit on your body. And together with the yoke, it\u2019s the rise that gives jeans their figure-hugging fit.The real difference in how jeans fit, though, is your body type. But many of us continuously struggle to find jeans that fit well because we often forget to take our body type into account.I\u2019ve identified five common male body types. If you\u2019d like to learn about each of them, check outmy in-depth fit guide.How Would You Like the Jeans to Feel?One of the key reasons jeans have become the world\u2019s most popular garment is that they\u2019re comfortable. The way jeans fit has a lot to do with that. Generally, fits that give us more room are more comfortable. But with a soft and stretchy fabric, even the tighest fit can be comfortable.Adding stretch to the denim is one of the most common ways of ensuring comfort. The weight of the denim also matters; usually, lightweight denims are the most comfortable. You can also go for a denim that\u2019s loosely woven, like Iron Heart\u2019s 21 oz. denim (above), which is surprisingly comfortable for a denim that heavy. As long as you factor in an extra bit of stretching out when you\u2019re finding your size.Talking about denim that changes in dimensions as you wear and wash it, you should consider whether the denim is pre-shrunk or not. Most denim is today, and it\u2019s done with the fabric finishing process called \u2018sanforization.\u2019 But if the denim is \u2018unsanforized,\u2019 it\u2019ll shrink up to around 10% after the first couple of washes. That\u2019s something else you really need to factor in when you\u2019re finding your size.Naturally, the fabric is also essential for the way the jeans fade. That opens up a whole other discussion, which leads us into talking abouthow the denim is made. For now, let\u2019s just assume the denim is going to get great fades.The Guy Who Built This Site Has Launched a Brand!It\u2019s called Weirloom, and the newWL#1 Regular Fitjeans are complete with a leather patch, branded buttons, and a new woven label.Learn more and buy a pair here.How Long Do You Need the Jeans To Be?Lastly, in phase #2, I want you to consider is how long the jeans should be. You need to decide whether you\u2019re planning to cuff the jeans or not. If you are, you probably need to size up in length.If you don\u2019t plan to cuff but the jeans are only available in a length that\u2019s too long, you can always have them hemmed. Just be aware that few tailors in Europe can do that with the original chain stitch. That\u2019s one of the reasons many denimheads simply just cuff their jeans. Which by the way also shows off that beautiful selvedge ID on shuttle-loomed denim.Planning to cuff your jeans or not?With the length of the jeans, you should again pay extra attention if the denim is unsanforized; that 10%-shrinkage is going to be most pronounced in the legs, where it might translate to around 10 centimetres.Answering the three questions above will get you a long way towards finding the perfect pair of jeans. Once you\u2019ve bought them, you enter phase #3.Phase #3: Post-PurchaseThis is when the real fun begins and you (finally) get to wear the jeans! As you live in and with your jeans, you\u2019ll usually go through the following steps, which will likely make you ask questions about:Breaking-inWashing and cleaningRepairsWhat to Expect from Breaking In Raw DenimThe first days and weeks in your new jeans might be a little uncomfortable. Especially if you\u2019ve chosen a tight fit or a heavier denim. But just hang in there, even the stiffest raw denim will eventually get soft as you break it in.To ease this process a little, consider soaking the jeans before you start wearing them. Doing so will also make the jeans last longer and postpone crotch blowouts and other rips.With new raw denim, you\u2019ll probably also experience what\u2019s known as \u2018bleeding\u2019 or \u2018crocking.\u2019 That\u2019s a fancy way of saying the colour will rub off. Soaking might minimise this a bit, but how much they bleed totally depends on the denim.Bleeding denim is not a bad thing, because you want the colour to come off. But maybe you don\u2019t want it on your white leather sofa. Don\u2019t panic when your other clothes become blue, the colour comes off in the wash.How to Wash and Clean Your Raw DenimHow to wash raw denim is a topic that usually causes a lot of discussion among denimheads. I wash my jeans. Not only because I think washing makes denim look better, it also makes it last as long as possible.With a lot of wear and no washing, raw denim becomes brittle. The starch that\u2019s left in the denim from the production process hasn\u2019t been washed out. When you combine that with grime and dirt that builds up over months without no washing, you get less durable denim.The fit also impacts how long the jeans will last. The tighter the jeans are, the quicker you\u2019ll wear out the denim in places with high friction, such as the crotch. Stretch in the denim usually accelerates the process further.If you want to learn how to wash your jeans, check out my guidehere. You might also want to take a look at some ofthe most common denim care myth.Why You Should Expect to Repair Your JeansAs you wear your jeans, they will eventually start falling apart. When they do, you should have them repaired instead of simply buying a new pair.Denim is quite easy to repair! And not is it good for your wallet and the environment, repairs also make your jeans look even cooler.Photo credit:Indigo ProofThe most common places for jeans to wear out is around the knee, the crotch area, and essentially anywhere the denim creases. It\u2019s usually the warp yarn that breaks first as it gets the most wear.You can repair your jeans with darning, sewing or ironing on patches, or even with special fabric glue (something I wouldn\u2019t recommend, though).A quality repair done on a darning machine by a professional will cost you around $25-$50. It might be sound expensive, but since it\u2019ll significantly extend the lifetime of your jeans, you\u2019ll be saving money in the long run. The problem is few places offer proper darning, so you might have to mail your jeans to the tailor, possibly to another country or continent.That brings us to the end of this guide.

Samurai Jeans have a nearly unmatched lineup including some of Japan\u2019s hardest and heaviest raws.They\u2019ve also got some of the most stylish fits in the game. Their iconic cuts are as sharp as a katana blade\u2014the samurai\u2019s weapon of choice\u2014and we want to help you pick the fit that\u2019s best for you.For those new to the brand, knowing which pair to pick isn\u2019t always easy. The model numbers can be a little confusing. Unlike most other brands, the numbers on the waist patch (the lot numbers) don\u2019t say anything about how the pair will fit.The Guy Who Built This Site Has Launched a Brand!It\u2019s called Weirloom, and the newWL#1 Regular Fitjeans are complete with a leather patch, branded buttons, and a new woven label.Learn more and buy a pair here.Also, you might have seen the disclaimer that our guides here on Denimhunters are \u201creader-supported\u201d.

Once you know what you\u2019re looking at, they\u2019re actually pretty easy to decipher.This system started with the brand\u2019s first pairs released in 1998, which were given the lot number 0. The year 1999 got lot number 1, and so forth.If there is a three-digit number following the lot number, this is the SKU number, which helps the brand and its retailers track their stock.This pair with \u201c23\u201d on the patch was produced in 2021This pair with SKU number 000 is probably a sampleTo find out what fit we\u2019re looking at, we need the model number, which appear on the flasher and in online listings. In the case of the jeans above, the model number is S5000VX21ozII.All we\u2019re concerned with in this guide is the first part: theS5000. That is the fit. The rest of the model number tells us about the denim, which is a whole other kettle of fish.We\u2019ve looked carefully at the measurements, crunching the numbers so you don\u2019t have to. We\u2019ve grouped the fits into two categories: straight and tapered. In each category, we\u2019ll start with the widest fit and progress to the slimmest.At the beginning of each section, we\u2019ve provided charts showing the key measuremets (in centimetres) across the board in a single size (34W).To make sure that we\u2019re comparing apples to apples, we\u2019re only going to look at the unwashed shrink-to-fit versions available in each of these fits.Now that we\u2019ve cleared that up, let\u2019s begin with the widest straight fit that Samurai make.Samurai Straight FitsSize 343000(0)51050050000500Waist8687.58788.588Thigh3129.628.828.329Rise33.131.73130.430.5Hem24.123.722.523.222.4Inseam909188.69091Vintage Straight:S3000The widest of Samurai\u2019s available fits, the3000cut combines a high rise with an extremely wide leg.If you put comfort before everything, if you\u2019ve got body-builder\u2019s thighs, or if your style icons wore denim in the 1930s or \u201840s, anything with 3000 in the model number will tick all your boxes.Indigo Invitational competitor, Bhaskar, put on a vintage fading clinic in Year One of the Invitational in his wide-legged S3000VX.The tranquil sea of sky blue that dominates the back of these jeans shows why serious vintage faders need at least one pair of Samurai straights in their collection.Comfortable Straight:510/0510If tapered fits give you the heebie jeebies, but if you don\u2019t want baggy denim, you can narrow it down to either the 510/0510, the slightly slimmer 500.Samurai\u2019s most popular fit in Japan, the 510 rides the wide line separating vintage and modern straights. The comfortable fit works exceptionally well on curvy figures and pairs brilliantly with slide-on boots.If this cut is still much too wide, skip down to start with the 710.Photos from HeddelsWe\u2019ve yet to see a competitor do serious damage to a pair of Samurai 510s, which is surprising considering how many beautifully faded examples we\u2019ve seen out there.We know that it\u2019s just a matter of time before a serious contender crosses the line wearing Samurai\u2019s flagship cut.Classic Straight:500/0500/5000The difference between the 500, the 0500 and the 5000 cuts is marginal. They\u2019re all medium rise jeans, and they all feature generous thighs and just a bit of taper below the knee. If your thighs need just that touch of extra room, the 500 will probably suit you best.If you like the extra room below the knee, the 5000 is a safer bet. If you tip towards the slim side both above and below the knee and if you prefer lighter denims, the 0500 will be perfect.Competitor Shane Burrow\u2019s muscular thighs made the S500AX a natural choice for him last year, and he beat the blue out of them, reminding us all why Samurai\u2019s natural indigo-dyed pairs (look for AX in the model) are highly sought after by vintage faders.On the other side of the planet, the slimmer Mousam Gogoi rode a 21oz pair of S5000VX into a top ten finish, showcasing the incredible high-contrast fade potential of the 5000 cut when it is combined with Samurai\u2019s heavier denims.The 0500, exclusively available in Samurai\u2019s 15oz Texas cotton denim, has all the makings of an exceptional competition pair. The denim with the famously rough hand is a perfect match with the barely slim straights.If the faded example above doesn\u2019t make your eyes pop out of your head, keep scrolling. The tapered fits below might ring your bell.Ready to buy a pair of Samurai Jeans?Just a gentle reminder that you can support us when you\u2019re buying Samurai products by getting yours from eitherRedcast Heritage,Big in Green,Franklin & Poe,CorlectionorBrooklyn Clothing Co.Samurai Tapered FitsSize 347100511003Waist878888Thigh28.528.527.5Rise29.929.528.9Hem21.520.420.6Inseam909191A Touch of Taper:710The710could go either way. While we\u2019ve classified this as a tapered fit, the taper is so subtle that this pair will be right down main street for fans of slim straights.Those who prefer tapered fits tend to find the 710s too generous below the knee, so, if you\u2019ve come here in search of Samurai\u2019s best tapered pair, the 0511 or the 003 might be more your bag.Muhammad Rizky left no doubt when he crossed the line in his 25oz pair of S710XX25oz-GDs in Year One of the Invitational. He earned himself a gold medal with deep-cut whiskers and combs and not even a sniff of stacking.The 25oz denim might be the best denim to reach for if you want a sure-fire way to create eye-catching contrasts. In our humble opinion, though, Samurai\u2019s fast-fading 19oz Kiwami selvedge has been Samurai\u2019s best denim since the brand debuted it in 2003. Samurai\u2019s 710 in their 19oz selvedge is, in our opinion, the most essential pair in their lineup.For proof of this, look no further than Chris Clark\u2019s Year Two Indigo Invitational pair. His beautiful results speak for themselves.Grown-Up Taper:0511This is one of the few times that the model number gives you a clue what kind of denim they\u2019ve used.Whenever you see a zero before the three-digit fit number (as with the 0500 and the 0510 above), you\u2019re looking at Samurai\u2019s 15oz Texas cotton denim\u2014a deeply underappreciated loom-state middleweight.As you can see with the pair faded beautifully by Emil (aka@weftyarn) below, it doesn\u2019t take long to get this pair moving. After a little less than six months of steady wear and regular washing, his pair shows exactly what this combination of fit and fabric can do.The0511leaves plenty of room in the thigh and top block, tapering gently. It\u2019s what Emil calls a grown-up taper, and we think that\u2019s an apt description of this cut.The 0511 fits most body shapes comfortably, but it works exceptionally well on men with some meat on their bones who don\u2019t want to swim in denim around their ankles.If this describes you, and if you\u2019re looking for a trim-fitting middleweight, the 0511 should be at the top of your list.Up and Down Slim Taper:003The last fit on our list, the gracefully tapered003, is slim from top to bottom. Though this pair is occasionally listed elsewhere as a slim taper, the Samurai bosses insist that this is an up-and-down slim straight.We\u2019ve placed it here because it\u2019s slim enough around the ankles to fit in the tapered category and because its snug fit from top to bottom makes it an unlikely choice for those who prefer classic straight fits.The rise is as low as they get for Samurai, and the thighs will be very snug if you\u2019ve got any padding around your hips. If, however, you\u2019re working with a compact frame (like Witsarut above), the 003 can end up fitting much like a 710. For reference, Witsarut is 5\u20197 and 143 pounds.The Cutting Room FloorOur search criteria meant that we had to exclude almost as many cuts as we included. Samurai frequently collaborates with other brands and retailers and regularly produces cuts exclusively for the overseas market.Because we\u2019ve only looked at their raw cuts, we\u2019ve had to exclude some of the brand\u2019s spectacular recent releases, like the comfort taperedS140,S211, andS520and the slim taperedS713andS0255.This also meant that we had to exclude their updated and once-washed versions of their standard cuts (designated with an II at the end of the model number). You can see comparisons of these updated cuts below, with the straight fits on the left and the tapered ones on the right.Updated Samurai StandardsSize 343000 (II)5000 (II)710 (II)511 (II)Waist86868686Thigh30.5272928.2Rise33.42831.230.7Hem2322.520.518.6Inseam87919188.2We could go on, but an exhaustive list of Samurai\u2019s available cuts would sprawl over a dozen pages or more. If the pair you\u2019re looking at isn\u2019t included on this list, you can use the numbers we\u2019ve provided as a reference. Remember that we\u2019ve used Size 34 as our standard throughout this list.As always, the best way to find the perfect fit is to head to your nearest Samurai-stocking retailer We can recommendRedcast Heritage,Big in Green,Franklin & Poe,CorlectionorBrooklyn Clothing Co., but you can also check outRivet & Hide,Self Edge, andOkayama Denim.Ideally, visit them in person to try on every pair that catches your eye until you find the perfect fit. If this isn\u2019t an option, and if this will be your first time trying Samurai cuts, pick an online retailer that has a flexible return policy.Remember as well that all the pairs we\u2019ve covered in detail above are unsanforized and unwashed. You can expect them to shrink approximately 4-6% when you introduce them to water.Once you\u2019ve washed or soaked them (which you can learnmuchmore about inthese guides), you won\u2019t be able to return them, so if you\u2019re trying an unwashed pair, be sure to include shrinkage in your calculations.Join 11,000+ Denimheads Who Get My EmailsYou\u2019ve finished this article\u2014hope you learned something new.

I put together this resource page so you have everything you need to buildyourlean, minimalist wardrobe.What Is A Lean, Minimal Wardrobe?You may call it a minimalist wardrobe, an interchangeable wardrobe, or something very similar.Around here, we refer to it as a Lean Wardrobe.LEAN WARDROBEA minimalist wardrobe; the minimum number of clothing items you need to create a flexible, well-rounded wardrobe thatsuitsyour daily life.Is A Lean, Minimal Wardrobe Right For Me?It does not matter if you are:young, old, or middle-agedlight-skinned, dark-skinned, or somewhere in betweenfat, skinny, or athleticshort, tall, or of average heightblessed with crazy deep pockets, on a strict budget, or somewhere in the middleThe Lean Wardrobe is aframeworkon how to approach building a wardrobe, regardless of your age, body type, or budget.Yes, the Lean Wardrobe is for youif you want a versatile, interchangeable set of clothes that you can wear every day, no matter where you\u2019re headed.Why a Lean Wardrobe is different (not your typical \u201cminimalist\u201d wardrobe)Most minimalists would boast about the small amount of clothing they have. They may limit themselves to 10 or 20 pieces.And while having an extremely minimal wardrobe may work well for them\u2026 it doesn\u2019t work for everyone.I\u2019m no clothing minimalist, and I don\u2019t expect you to be either.So how is the Lean Wardrobe different from the minimalism practices you often read and hear about?It\u2019s more aboutoptimizing, not minimizing.I want to help you curate a thoughtful wardrobe withthe right amountof clothing.

Unsubscribe any time.What clothing belongs in a man\u2019s Lean (or minimal, or interchangeable) Wardrobe?There is no one answer to this question because everyone\u2019s ideal Lean Wardrobe is different.It differs so much because every Lean Wardrobe heavily depends on your lifestyle, your budget, and your surroundings\u2026 and obviously, everyone\u2019s needs are slightly different.The good news is:you know your lifestyle, budget, and surroundings best, so putting together a Lean Wardrobe of your very own is easy!How to build a minimal wardrobe from scratchCan\u2019t just go out and start shopping. That\u2019s the final step in the process. First it\u2019s important to think through some things.1. Evaluate your lifestyle, budget, and surroundingsIt\u2019s important to give this some thought before buying stuff. Otherwise, you may end up buying clothing that doesn\u2019t truly make sense for you!Your LifestyleConsider what you do for work, what you enjoy doing during your downtime, and on the weekends. This will help determine how formal or casual (or what kind of mix) you need to go with.Your BudgetHow much do you have set aside for your new wardrobe? Having a number will help determine the amount you can buy, the quality of each piece, and in which areas it\u2019s worth it to splurge a bit more (and when to go the more affordable route).Your SurroundingsWhere do you live and what\u2019s the climate like? Is it mostly hot and humid, cold and windy, temperate and dry? Also, how do the people in your everyday life dress? Think about your neighbors, people you run into at the store or coffee shop, and the people you work with.2. Lean Wardrobe PyramidGet familiar with the Lean Wardrobe Pyramid. This is a graphical representation of how a Lean Wardrobe is set up.The BaseImagine your entire wardrobe as a pyramid.The base of your wardrobe should be made up of foundational pieces, classic and timeless items that work well in many different situations and aren\u2019t as susceptible to changing trends.Thebase of the pyramidis also its widest section. Similarly, your foundational pieces should make up the majority of your Lean Wardrobe, because it supports your whole wardrobe and anchors all your outfits.The MiddleThemiddle section of the pyramidis made up of clothes that may not be as versatile, but are still important in your wardrobe. This section could also include your seasonal items as well as pieces you only wear occasionally.The TopThetop section of the pyramidis made up of your trendy, experimental, nostalgic, and very occasionally worn items.And just like how this is the smallest section of the pyramid, this part of your wardrobe should contain the fewest number of clothes and accessories.You can read more about theLean Wardrobe Pyramid here \u00bb3. Think through your wardrobe (write it out)Now that you\u2019ve thought more about:Your unique lifestyle,Your budget,And your surroundingsAnd you\u2019ve been introduced to the Lean Wardrobe Pyramid and how clothing should fit into each level\u2026You can now start picking out the individual pieces you need.So which types of clothes do you need from each category? And how many of each?Again, this will depend on your lifestyle.For example, an attorney will most likely need 5-7suitsin his Lean Wardrobeminimum, while a graphic designer working at home can most likely get away with justone.Consider what\u2019s most important to have, based on what\u2019s currently in your closet and what you do day to day, and go from there.Download Your Copy of The Lean Wardrobe GuideIf you want to start your Lean Wardrobe the right way, sign up to the list below and I\u2019ll send you our free guide!

It\u2019s time for papa Barron to tell you a story from his childhood.It was 7:05am, and the sun peeked over the hills outside my window. Frost had developed overnight at the edges of the glass, hinting at a crisp, fall day ahead.I groggily started the process of getting ready for school. Iwashed my faceand styled my hair. All I had left to do was get dressed before grabbing a quick breakfast and heading out the door.Except I wasparalyzed. Leaning against the wall, staring into my closet.In a half-woken stupor, I must\u2019ve been standing there 5, 6 minutes, juststaring,like I was glancing into the abyss.I had no idea what to wear!All my options sucked. It was as if I only had 3 outfits to choose from.But if this were a cinematic film and the initial shot was cropped close, right over my shoulder, with me staring into the closet\u2026 the next shot would be a slow zoom out, finally showing the whole closet, FILLED WITH CLOTHES.The camera would then cut to the twootherclosets stuffed with clothing. And then back to my face, staring blankly like an idiot.THIS, my friends, was me in high school and college.A young guy who enjoyed fashion and style so much that he hadlots of clothing, yet nothing to wear.No simple basics in neutrals or earth tones (menswear neutrals) that all go with each other. Few perfect essentials.Instead, old T-shirts and pants I wasn\u2019t into anymore, super trendy pieces that matched with a limited number of other things, and cool stand-out clothes that I loved, but didn\u2019t feel confident enough to wear.A closet filled with cool stuff individually, butnothing versatile, nothing that went well together.Check This One Out, Too!The Perfect Men\u2019s Casual Capsule Wardrobe: 11 Essentials For The Effortless GentMen\u2019s Wardrobe Essentials = Fewer but better clothesBack To TopIt wouldn\u2019t be until many years later that I discovered how great it is to ownless.Fewer (but more awesome)items that fit well, are neutral in color, and go with everythingelse in my closet.I\u2019m still perfecting my ideal minimalist wardrobe.At this point, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a lifelong, ever-evolving process. I do still fall victim to the occasional\u201cWhat was I thinking?\u201dpurchase, though I\u2019ve gotten much better.If you\u2019ve ever been in young Barron\u2019s position\u2014staring into your closet with tons of options but feeling like you have nothing you want to wear\u2014a lean, minimalist wardrobe may be your saving grace.What exactly is a minimalist wardrobe?There are a few terms\u2014minimalist wardrobe, capsule wardrobe, lean wardrobe (what we call it on EG)\u2014that all describe the same thing:Minimalist Wardrobe:A man\u2019s wardrobe essentials; classic, quality items in neutral colors that are interchangeable and easily worn with each other.Read more here \u2192My story of getting dressed as a teen may sound familiar. It\u2019s a similar one echoed by many young\u2019ns experimenting with their personal style.As a result, they end up with a closet filled with clothing, yet wear only a small handful of those things.Keeping a lean, minimalist wardrobe requires some effort and regular pruning\u2026 but day to day, this type of wardrobe makes putting together sharp looking outfits much easier.Choosing your wardrobe essentialsFor this article, I singled out what Iactuallywear on a regular basis, and what makes up a versatile, interchangeable wardrobe. So I\u2019m presenting that to you today.One thing to remember:Don\u2019t look at my set of essentials as some hard-and-fast rule. I\u2019m not saying youhaveto own these things.This is where you\u2019ll need to exercise a bit of critical thinking. Consider where you live and what you do day to day.If you live in Miami, Florida, you probably won\u2019t need a heavy winter parka. If you\u2019re a computer engineer, maybe you don\u2019t need fivesuits(unless you just like wearingsuitsevery day\u2026that\u2019s cool too)Consider my essentials more like a boilerplate template;a place to start. Feel free to add and remove items that make or don\u2019t make sense for you.A lean, minimalist wardrobe is different for every guy, depending on hisSIS. And the actual, final wardrobe depends on what he already has based on theLean Wardrobe Pyramid.RELATED ARTICLESNo idea what an SIS is? Pyramid what? If you\u2019re still figuring outhowto build a Lean Wardrobe,go over the articles on this resource page \u00bbOh, and if you\u2019re concerned about how dressy or casual one of these items is, you need to study theSpectrum of Style Formality \u00bbMen\u2019s Wardrobe Essentials: My suggestionsBack To TopJeansEG'S TOP PICKBonobos Jeans$98Bonobos has jeans for any body type, with a variety of different washes and types of denim fabric (stretch, premium selvedge, etc.)Check Latest PriceDenim is a standard in most guys\u2019 closets.Perfect for everyday, casual activities\u2026 from running errands on a Saturday, to meeting friends or your partner for after-work drinks and dinner.My favorite pants (both denim and chinos) are fromBonobos.Another one of my go-to denim brands is Levi\u2019s. The problem with Levi\u2019s is that they change model numbers all the time and it\u2019s hard to keep up.Check This One Out, Too!The Best Tapered Jeans That Every Guy Needs In His ClosetAs of this writing, I prefer the541 Athletic Fit(you may have to size down) or the502 Regular Taperedmodel. If you\u2019re slim,the 512is a good choice.I like slim and tapered (or athletic) cuts because they\u2019re designed to have room in the legs and seat, but the leg opening tapers, or becomes smaller, which looks much more clean (clean lines, clean lines!).If you want to be truly minimal, you only need one pair:Dark, raw, unwashed indigo.I also have a medium- and light-washed pair. Because, well, I like variety, and I don\u2019t always want to wear dark denim, especially in warmer weather.Casual chinosBack To TopEG's TOP PICKBonobos Chinos$98Your search for the perfect chinos ends here. Bonobos' chinos offer superior comfort, dozens of colors, and quality that lasts.SHOP NOWIf I\u2019m not in jeans, I\u2019m wearing chinos.I don\u2019t particularly like the medium khaki color (I call them \u201cmiddle management khakis\u201c), but I do like the British khaki / caramel color, a few shades darker.I also wear a medium grey or charcoal pair a lot. Grey goes with everything and these chinos are so versatile.Bonobos makes myfavorite chinos. For a dressier option, check outSpier & Mackay\u2019s chinos, cords, and shorts.Uniqloalso makes great casual chinos.As far as fit is concerned, they\u2019re similar to my denim: medium rise, athletic, tapered cut, no break. You can see how some of my casual pants fithere.Dress pants / trousersBack To TopEG's TOP PICKSpier & Mackay Trousers$58+Spier & Mackay makes high-quality and well-fitted modern menswear at a wallet-friendly price.Check Latest PriceFor slightly dressier situations, I have more formal options for pants.In this case, dressier chinos and wool trousers with extended tab closures, cuffs, and sharp pleats. These characteristics aren\u2019t essential for a dressier pair of pants, but all of mine happen to have them, because I like them.Taste and preference comes over time bypayingattentionwhen you see looks you like.My dressier chinos and wool trousers fit the same as my other pants: mid-rise, athletic cut with a taper down to the leg opening, no break (more info aboutproper break length hereandhere).DressShirtsBack To TopEG's TOP PICKKamakura Shirts$79+Japanese-produced, fine quality dress shirts made from 100% cotton, non-fused interlining, natural shell buttons, and single needle seamsCheck Latest PriceWe earn a commission if you click this link and make a purchase at no additional cost to you.While any man can benefit from a variety of dressshirts, the true workhorses will be those in white and light blue.Charles Tyrwhitthas a solid, good looking product for a competitive price. Plenty of fabrics, patterns, and fits. The Tie Bar also has agreat selection of dress shirtsthat fit well and are at a great price point.Another favorite isKamakurabased out of Japan. Slightly pricer than CT and Tie Bar but I\u2019d argue quality and construction are incomparable. These feel like $250shirtsbut they start at $79.If you\u2019re like me and sport asmart, sharp, casual style, your go-to combo is more denim, sportshirts, and sport coats instead of fullsuits, so maybe you don\u2019t need any more than two.Again, feel free to adjust this number and do a bit of critical thinking.If you wearsuitsevery day, you\u2019ll probably need several of each, plus other easy-to-pair optionsIf you rarely don a suit, 2-3 total should doIn this case, I prefer a light lavender, light pink, and alight blue and whitestripeshirt.SportShirtsBack To TopEG's TOP PICKUniqlo Oxford Shirts$39.90100% cotton with an excellent cut and generous button-down collarCheck Latest PriceAllllrighty, now we\u2019re getting into theshirtsI wear most.

And during the winter, they\u2019re the perfect layering piece over ashirtand underneath a peacoat for added warmth.EG's TOP PICKAlex Mill Sweaters + Sweatshirts$50+Alex Mill is timeless, not trendy.

It\u2019sperfect for layeringand protects me from most New York winter days.If you\u2019re further north than I am, you may need something more substantial (like the Canada Goose parka), but for me, this works just fine.A puffer coat is perfect for casual fits, and when you want warmth without the weight of a peacoat.For a dressier alternative, you\u2019ll want to invest in a longertop coatorduffle coat.Dress ShoesBack To TopEG's TOP PICKBeckett SimononStarting at $149Premium handcrafted shoes without premium prices.SHOP NOWI mentioned earlier that I don\u2019t have to dress formally too often (I\u2019m more of a chinos/jeans + sport coat guy), but I have a few lace-ups that fit the bill should I have to throw on a suit.These black oxfords with subtle wingtip detail and plain oxblood bluchers are my \u201cdressiest\u201d pairs.Check This One Out, Too!The Ultimate Guide to Brown Dress ShoesTheAllen Edmonds Strandon the right would serve as myleastformal pair, based on color and broguing (but these days, still totally fine with a suit).

My essentials may not work for a guy who lives insuitsduring the week (and vice versa).But finding YOUR definitive list is much easier. You just have to observeyourself, see what you do during the week, consider the weather where you live, and how much you\u2019re willing to spend.Will your essentials change? Over time, sure, probably. I own and wear things regularly today that I didn\u2019t have 5 years ago. I can think of items I wore 5 years ago that I wouldn\u2019t dare wear today.If you had to whittle your wardrobe down tojustthe essentials, what items would be left standing?

      "body": "When a man is building himself a minimalist wardrobe but still learning the ins and outs of dressing well and classifying casual outfits vs. formal outfits, buying new clothing or organizing what he\u2019s got may seem like an insurmountable challenge.He\u2019s probably asking himself questions such as:Where do I begin?What\u2019s most important?How can I even tell the difference?My first inclination is to point him to theLean Wardrobephilosophy, but even before he goesthatfar, I think he\u2019d need a bit more background\u2026 a road map, if you will, so he knows where he\u2019s going.The Lean Wardrobe Pyramid: Visualizing The Perfect Men\u2019s Minimalist WardrobeSo, here\u2019s my theory that should prove useful to the gent who\u2019s still attempting to create the perfect men\u2019s minimalist wardrobe.Let\u2019s think of the Lean Wardrobe as a pyramid, split into three levels.click to enlargeThe bottom is your base.It comprises the building blocks of your wardrobe. All your essentials. Yourbasics, in both garment style and color.This is where your navy suit is, your dark denim, your khaki chinos, your T-shirt, your blue Oxford cloth button down.These are typically solid, muted, and / or neutral in color.They go with everything, and they play nicely with each other.The middle levelcontains pieces that are limited in their ability to mix with others.Think bolder patterns, textures, and colors. Your multi-colored plaid, a yellowginghambutton-down, that plum-coloredhenley, those green twill chinos.These things go well with your base-level items one-on-one, but not so easily with each other.It\u2019s certainly possible, you\u2019d just have to understand how tomatch and complement colorsand textures well.The top levelcontains all your trendy, one-off or standout items. Things you see other people wear and want to try, too.These are items like a white fedora,purple bowties with sunglass print, suspenders, a bold blazer, an in-your-face pocket square.Own fewer items the more you move up the pyramidIn keeping with the Lean Wardrobe theory,you want a majority of your closet to contain the base items, things that are interchangeable in style and color, because these pieces will go with everything no matter what other clothing you choose.You shouldown the fewest top-level items, those unique (yet inflexible) pieces.They\u2019re great to finish off or accent your base outfit, but shouldn\u2019t comprise your whole wardrobe. Not only would that be impractical, but you limit yourself in terms of interchangeability with the rest of your clothing.Clothing in your base level \u2260 someone else\u2019sWhat\u2019s trendy or outstanding to you (i.e. suspenders), may be part of someone else\u2019s base level.The ideal Lean Wardrobe is different for everyone, and completely dependent upon one\u2019s situation, income, and surroundings.Just keep that in mind when you\u2019re building your wardrobe. Find out what\u2019s important to you and what fits your lifestyle best, and roll with that.The complete Lean, Minimalist Wardrobe is MORE than just essentialsSure, a majority of itisyour essentials, your base-level items. These clothes are your wardrobe\u2019s building blocks, the starting point of all your outfits.But awardrobe built on essentialsalone is kind of\u2026 boring.You need mid-level items and top-leveltrendy accessories.You need to introducecolorin your wardrobe other than navy, gray, khaki, and white.You need toexperiment with trendsoutside of your comfort zone, because who knows, you may discover something you originally thought too far outside your level of comfort is actually pretty awesome and looks great on you. That means you can incorporate it more regularly in your rotation.Does that help?Curious to know if this helps you visualize the Lean Wardrobe idea better. Also would love to know if you prefer these shorter, more succinct posts vs our longer-form writing.Let\u2019s chat in the comments below!",

Often, I keep it simple with black, navy, grey, and brown. My staples, like chambrayshirts, OCBDs, and grey T-shirts, are the lightest colors that stay in the closet.Example of a spring / summer palette (two left) vs. a fall / winter palette (two right).And for spring and summer, we go the opposite route:lighter colors and pastels (white, light grey, light blue, lavender, light pink, cream / tan)bright and vibrant hues (neon green, orange, magenta, electric blue)fun patterns and printsI even wear my dark denim less, and instead, swap them with my lightweight, stretch, light-wash denim.

And for items that don\u2019t exist in the default option (mid-layers), simply add it in (e.g.,shirt+ vest + sport coat)In terms of weather-appropriateness (thicker, warmer layers), here\u2019s what I would suggest:Fall and WinterShirtsBonoboschambray button downandtwill button downshirts; Todd Snyderbutton down flannelChambray isn\u2019t exactly a fall- and winter-specificshirt. But\u2026 I think of it like denim: easily worn year-round.

And then take it off when you get warm again\u2026 it\u2019s a vicious cycle.Aesthetically, you can put together a more interesting look with multiple layers. So really, sweaters and vests not only regulate body temps better, they also add extraoomphto your outfit.It\u2019s important to make sure you have2-3 versatile middle layers, such as vests and quarter zip sweaters (which are pretty much interchangeable). To maximize versatility, stick with neutral colors like grey, navy, black, tan or brown.Most guys have a plenty of inner layers (like button upshirts) and outer layers (lightweight jackets), but the crucial middle layer is sometimes overlooked. My current favorite affordable middle layer is theJ.Crew Factory Walker vest.Brock McGoffFounder,The Modest ManFall and Winter PantsMid-grey flannel trousers, Bonoboswashed chinosDenim is a great option for fall and winter.

You\u2019re accustomed to shoes ending at the ankle.To be honest, the only right way is whatever keeps you most dry.Cuff up your denim (tips in this video), let them sit in between the boot\u2019s tongue and back tab, or tuck them in if you have to. What matters most is arriving to your destination dry.If your cuff naturally drapes over the boot, that\u2019s fine. But if your pants get wet, start rolling them up! Don\u2019t stress about the rules of winter fashion. Adapt, my friends. Adapt.Protect Your Leather Shoes from Wet WeatherIf you work in a formal setting that requiresleather dress shoes, they\u2019ll be okay, so long as you putcedar shoe treesin them at the end of the day. Let the leather rest. That\u2019s very important.Shoe trees. Rest for a day.If you have to walk places in wet weather, you might want to invest in someovershoeswhich will further protect the shoes\u2019 leather from the elements.If it\u2019s an extra snowy day, I\u2019d suggest taking your shoesin your bag(video), and wearing snow boots on your commute. Change when you get to the office.How To Deal With Salt Stains On Your ShoesPeeps in snowy areas,watchout for salt on your leather shoes. Salt + leather shoes = sad face, big time. This is all the more reason to NOT wear your nice leather shoes when you\u2019re commuting by foot (and whereboots like the Sorelswould come in handy).If you absolutelymustwear your leather shoes when braving the elements (and you don\u2019t already have a pair ofovershoes, tsk tsk) treat them with care as soon as you reach your destination.A simple wipe-off should suffice.Be thorough; any stray slush or salt water will stain your shoes. And getting that stain removed is a pain in the butt.Conditioning and polishing the leatherwill help keep your shoes in tip-top shape and ready for whatever you throw at it.This is another reason (if you haven\u2019t yet been motivated) to polish your shoes regularly.Think of it like moisturizing your skin after showering. If you don\u2019t moisturize, you dry out, your skin gets rough and cracked, etc.Your leather shoeswork the same way.Want a step-by-step solution for de-salting (that\u2019s not a word) your shoes? Check outthis concise guidefrom Valet Magazine.How to Avoid Slipping on the IceIf you\u2019re more concerned about your own safety (walking around on wet, icy, or snowy ground with leather soles is not very fun or sexy), then you have some alternatives.Take your leather-soled shoes to a cobbler and have athin rubber layeradded. Many places do this and it shouldn\u2019t be tough to find a cobbler who knows what you\u2019re asking for.I\u2019ve heard arguments for and against this method. Some say it\u2019s perfectly fine and they haven\u2019t experienced any problems. Others have said adding a rubber layer decreases the breathability of the leather and can trap in moisture which leads to rotting, curling of the rubber, and in general, ruins your shoes long term.I\u2019ll leave it up to you to do the research and decide whether or not this is a good solution for you.Another option I keep suggesting throughout this article is to useSwims, which are overshoes (aka galoshes) that protect your shoes from the elements. They also increase your sole\u2019s grip so you don\u2019t slip and slide.Some people think this is super nerdy. Others (like myself) think they look kinda cool. I don\u2019t yet own a pair, but I\u2019m inclined to pick some up and try them out. I encourage you to do the same; feel free to report back to me for extra bonus points.For me, the best solution is a pair of dress shoes with a rubber or combination rubber/leather sole that you use on rainy and wet days.(More on that in ourcomplete guide to brown leather shoes.)The grippy rubber keeps you safe, minimizing slippage as you walk around. Aesthetically, you get the same look as your other dress shoes.

But, men, I know that doesn\u2019t help when figuring out how to findyourstyle.When considering your own personal style, look at your clothing as an extension of yourself. For some, this discernment and level of taste can take years to develop, while others are born with a sense of who they are and how they want to dress. Either way, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t achieve an admirable look on the fly.Style, like most things in life, has shortcuts. Our goal here is to give you a starting point for great style. If you\u2019re unsure of an outfit or are pressed for time, you need look no further than these unique and unexpected shortcuts.I use these tips all the time (especially the first one) whenever I need to run out of the house in a hurry. Let\u2019s jump in.1. Go for Black: The Best Base for OutfitsA black base is the best way to startdressing well. Most people already have a pair of black pants and a black T-shirt just laying around, and if they fit you well then you are already 75% of the way to a stylish look.Nobody has ever looked bad in black. Not only does black accentuate your positive body traits, it also slims you down, giving you a more svelte silhouette.Your jeans can be fromOld Navyand your tee fromUniqloif you\u2019re on a budget, or you can buy jeans from Frame and T-shirts from Margiela if you want to ball out. Either way, the sentiment remains the same: All black is the quickest shortcut to great style.Once you have the all-black look down, you can start experimenting withgood outerwear.You can opt for acollared shirt,shirt jacket, trucker jacket, bomber, short coat, the list goes on and on. When you have on black as a base, you literally can wear anything you want \u2014 black is the truest neutral you can get.Examples of all black (or mostly black) outfits worth trying if you\u2019re stuckA Quick (Actionable) Example of Pulling off Black As Your Outfit\u2019s BaseWhen I don\u2019t know what to wear, I usually follow a tried-and-true formula: a pair of straight black jeans from the Gap that I\u2019ve had for a while and look good on my body (other days I opt for a pair of vintage Levi\u2019s 545 jeans), a black Uniqlo Airism T-shirt, and a baseball cap or a beanie depending on the weather.Uniqlo Supima Cotton Crew Neck T-Shirt$19.90Check Latest PriceThen, I\u2019ll throw on one of my best jacketsand a pair of clean sneakersand I\u2019m good to go.

Look at how John Legend dresses. He is a pro and I\u2019ve taken this strategy from his playbook.2. Don\u2019t Be Unique: Have a UniformI\u2019m usually not the biggest proponent of uniform dressing. I love having an array of outfits for different occasions, and I love clothes way too much to wear the same thing every day.With that said,a uniform can be greatfor someone who\u2019s figured out what works for them and what they like, as well as a reliable once-in-a-while fall-back for guys more like me.A Perfect Uniform ExampleIt may take some trial and error, but if you can find the right outfit or group of outfits that work day in and day out, you\u2019ll be set.You\u2019ll Love This One, TooMen\u2019s Wardrobe Essentials: All You Need For A Minimal And Versatile WardrobeYour uniform can be just about anything.

Two pairs of derbies (one from Dr. Martens, the other from Paraboot), and one leather jacket.Of course, he has other clothes like shorts and T-shirts for the gym, a winter coat, andsome sneakersfor when the time is right. But for the most part he sticks to his uniform.A uniform can simply be an option for the days you need something reliable to fall back on.Andy Spade\u2019s Daily UniformI wrote apiece for the blog Sprezzaa few months back about Andy Spade, Kate Spade\u2019s widower and fashion mogul. His daily fit consists of Clarks desert boots, beat up Levi\u2019s 501s, and oxford clothbutton-downshirts.He has several variations of each piece and looks sharp and put together every day. Sometimes you wake up in the morning not knowing what to put on. Having a game-tested outfit can be a saving grace.3.

Accessorize: Not Too Much, Not Too LittleI love accessories \u2014 I love jewelry, I lovewatches,I love hats. Accessories are an easy way to express your personality and show off your taste level when you\u2019re getting dressed.They may also have sentimental value. Perhaps a memento from a favorite concert or a tribute to a beloved locale.I have souvenir accessories from NBA finals games I\u2019ve attended, concerts I\u2019ve enjoyed, and cities I\u2019ve visited. They\u2019re a great way to tell your personal story.For that reason,accessorizing is one of the best waysto gain some personal style.The sunglasses I wear daily came from St. Mark\u2019s Place in the East Village during my first trip to New York City.

When in Doubt, Go VintageDo you ever look at old photos of stylish, well-dressed people, and think to yourself, \u201cHow can I look like them?\u201d Well, I do that often, and it\u2019s one of my secret weapons to stylish outfit building.Finding inspirationis the first step to achieving the personal style you\u2019re seeking.For me, that inspiration comes from looking at photos ofclassic mens\u2019 style iconslike Cary Grant, Steve McQueen, and Miles Davis, or contemporaries like Jacob Elordi, Tyler, The Creator, or Brooklyn Beckham.The most fun part about trying to recreate old outfits is the hunt for vintage gems. Pre-loved and worn in clothing always looks great (and feels incredibly comfortable). Used clothing just has more character than any newly purchased item ever could.Where To Shop For VintageTo me,eBay,Poshmark,Grailed, andEtsyare just the perfect places to shop for clothes (truly, I cannot sing eBay\u2019s praises enough).Men's Clothing and Accessories on eBayClothing, shoes and accessories... get everything you need from brands you love!Shop eBayIf you pick up a cool vintage piece, chances are you won\u2019t see anybody else wearing it in the wild, adding to your personal flavor.Items that I like to pick up include used T-shirts, jeans, sweaters, and outerwear. Some of my coolest jackets are used. I have a Professional Bull Riders work jacket that I found on eBay for about $45 and I wear it all the time.I get compliments whenever I wear it into stores, and I always catch people turning their heads when I\u2019m wearing it in public.Of course, you can always opt to go \u201cvintage shopping\u201d in your own closet, as well.

That\u2019s where these shortcuts will come in handy.No one has looked bad in a black T-shirt and black jeans. If you\u2019re into the luxurious minimalist look then run out to your nearest Uniqlo and pick out your favorites from their U line.If you already have an outfit or two that you know is tried and true, it\u2019ll make a great fallback.There\u2019s several paths to good style, but these tips are universal and will guarantee you a strong outfit wherever you go.

      "title": "Finding The Perfect Loafer",
      "body": "If I could only have three pairs of shoes, I\u2019d go with a pair of loafers, some Norwegian split-toes, and some kind of boot (either work boots or side-zips). Like most men, I rarely wear a \u201cserious suit\u201d nowadays. \u201cSerious suits\u201d are limited to weddings, funerals, and other \u201cserious occasions,\u201d which means I don\u2019t have much use for formal shoes such as oxfords (which, to my eye, only look right with suits). Derbies, on the other hand, can be worn with suits or sport coats, which gives them some versatility.Loafers are more casual still. For most people, they can be worn three seasons out of the year. They go just as well with summer sport coats as they do with autumnal tweeds. Depending on their design, they can also be worn with casual outfits. Loafers are easy to slip off and easier to slip on. And if you\u2019re the type of person to wear shoes without socks, bare ankles look more natural with slip-ons than lace-ups.Choosing the right pair, however, requires some sensitivity to different design elements. Some loafers look better with sharply tailored trousers, while others look more at home with faded jeans. Some lean traditional, while others are fashion-forward. There\u2019s no such thing as an \u201cultimate loafer,\u201d but there are some that are better suited to your needs, lifestyle, and wardrobe. Here are some choices, along with suggestions on how to think through these various design elements.The Casual Penny LoaferWhen you close your eyes and imagine a penny loafer, you\u2019re probably thinking of something like Bass Weejuns. These are your most casual pennies. Depending on their design, you can wear them with tailored chinos and a safari jacket or something as simple as jeans and a Harrington. You can even wear them with shorts and a madras shirt (a very New England look).When trying to discern a loafer\u2019s formality, look first at the shape.Casual loafers will be rounder than their sleeker, more formal counterparts. They will often have minimal shaping near the waist (that part of the shoe that comes in near the arch of your foot).There may be other casualizing elements. Some penny loafers are made from a more casual leather, such asHorween\u2019s Chromexcel. Others may be unlined, which means the uppers feel more comfortable, but they\u2019ll reveal the shape of your foot more readily when worn (sort of like espadrilles). Many will have rougher stitching \u2014 a lower stitch count per inch, contrast colored threads, thicker threads, and saddle stitching around the apron (that part of the shoe that sits at the edge of the toe box). An apron with a raised lipped will look more casual than one that\u2019s flatter and more discrete. Beefrolls on both sides of the penny strap, a stitched ridge at the heel cup, and flat rubber sole can also make a loafer look casual.You can find these from brands such asRancourt,Oak Street Bootmakers, andJay Butler. Slightly more refined versions, such asAurland(supposedly the original penny loafer), will have a similar casual vibe, but look less trad. These are the type of loafers you\u2019ll want to wear with jeans, chinos, or shorts when hanging out at a BBQ, relaxing in the neighborhood, or doing other casual activities. Keep them with casualwear, rather than tailoring.Options:Sid Mashburn,Ralph Lauren,Oak Street Bootmakers,Rancourt,Aurland,Shipton & Heneage Milan, andJay Butler CromwellThe Dressy Penny LoaferIf you want something you can wear with suits and sport coats, choose a sleeker, more shapely penny loafer made from fine calfskin or suede. Loafers with finer, tonal stitching look dressier than ones with rougher stitching. A flatter apron will often look dressier than one with a raised lip, but it\u2019s all about execution. In the photo above, you can see a pair ofCrockett & Jones Roseberywith a subtly raised lip that still looks relatively formal. It\u2019s just not as raised or rough as what you see on theseRalph Laurens.The design of the vamp here is often overlooked as a design element.The term vamp refers to that part of the shoe that sits on top of your foot. High-vamp loafers come up higher on your foot, while low-vamp loafers terminate closer to your toes. As Mark Cho of The Armoury demonstrates in the video above, even when loafers are built on the same last, a higher vamp can help elongate the shape of your foot. This makes the shoes look sleeker and thus dressier.For me,Edward Green\u2019s Piccadillyis the Platonic form of a dressy loafer. It\u2019s sleek and shapely without being aggressively sharp. When made with the company\u2019s dark oak leather, it\u2019s something you can wear with nearly any tailored outfit. The only problem is the price. At about $1,300 retail, it\u2019s painfully expensive. Even on eBay, you\u2019ll find gently used versions going for about $750. Solid alternatives includeFoster & Son Burford,The Armoury\u2019s Duane,Carmina 80191,Sons of Henrey, andMeermin 114284.Options:Edward Green Piccadilly,The Armoury Duane,George Cleverley Bradley,Crockett & Jones Rosebery,L\u00f6f & Tung Francisco,L\u00f6f & Tung Abreau,Morjas,Carmina 80708,Carmina 80191,Alden,TLB Mallorca Martin,TLB Mallorca Artista,Sons of Henrey,Shipton & Heneage Wilton,Meermin 114284, andMeermin 101484The In-Betweener Penny LoaferDressy loafers look most at home with tailored clothing, while casual loafers look better when kept to casualwear. But what if you want a versatile loafer that can do both? Straddling these two worlds can be like threading a needle, but it can be done.First, a lot depends on your wardrobe. If your tailoring leans trad (more straight-waisted American, rather sleek Italian or structured British) and your casualwear leans classic, it\u2019s easier to find loafers that can do double duty. The key is to get loafers with a mix of the different design elements mentioned above: a rounder last, rather than sleek, and something with a combination of formal and informal elements. You want something made from a \u201cdress shoe\u201d leather, such as fine calfskin, scotch grain leather, or shell cordovan, rather than uber-casual material such as Horween\u2019s Chromexcel. Raised lipped aprons and split-toe seams can make a dressy loafer look causal, but beefrolls would be a step too far.There are two excellent options here.Alden\u2019s Leisure Handsewn(colloquially known as the LHS) is ideal if your style leans trad. It\u2019s perfect for wearing with things such as Shetland sweaters, oxford button-downs, and five-pocket cords. At the same time, you can dress it up with a sport coat and pair of flannel trousers. This is the post-war Ivy look \u2014 a style that perfectly expresses the dressed-down, tailored style that the United States made famous.Get the LHS in Horween\u2019s #8 shell cordovanif you can afford it. Otherwise, it also looks great inbrown suede.Alternatively, you can also tryJM Weston\u2019s 180, a high-walled penny loafer that\u2019s closely associated with theBCBG social group in France. In the United States, this JM Weston loafer doesn\u2019t carry the same class connotations, so it\u2019s easier to wear these with a mix of things. The 180 goes well with tailored trousers and a sport coat, sometimes even casual suits. At the same time, the chunky silhouette looks natural with jeans and casualwear from labels such asCamoshita,Private White VC, andDe Bonne Facture.Options:Alden Leisure Handsewn,JM Weston 180,Crockett & Jones Boston,Crockett & Jones Harvard,L\u00f6f & Tung Xavier,John Lobb Lopez,Sid Mashburn,Carmina 80579,Carmina 10082,Allen Edmonds Randolph,Allen Edmonds Cavanaugh,Grant Stone Traveler,Barbanera,Shipton & Heneage Arran, andVass NorwegerThe Flashy Horsebit LoaferIn the world of slip-on shoes, no style is more controversial than the horsebit. The style is associated with flashy dressers, aggressive powerbrokers, and arrivistes. In the 2013 filmThe Wolf of Wall Street, New York stockbroker Jordan Belfort (played by Leonard DiCaprio) wears jet-black Gucci horsebit loafers with strong-shouldered pinstripe suits, starched white collars, and power ties. The silhouette perfectly conveys the sort of greed-is-good ethos that we associate with bankers in the 1980s, when this film was set.Reasonably, many people shy away from snaffle bit loafers for these reasons. They can feel too aggressive and flashy, like wearing the footwear version of a gold Rolex. At the same time, the style has some important design elements that make it surprisingly versatile. The ridged apron and rounded toe allow it to look at home with jeans, while the dressy leather and shiny horsebit make dressy enough for suits. In his bookElegance, Bruce Boyer writes: \u201cIn short, it was the first shoe that bridged the gap between casual and business wear. This dressy slip-on was refined with fine, lightweight calfskin, a pared-down shape, and a metal snaffle bit, and as such, it became avenue-elegant and gained acceptance in corporate board rooms and country clubs alike.\u201dIf you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll probably never step foot in a country club or corporate board room. But there\u2019s still something appealing about this loafer. It looks great with drapey suits or sport coats \u2014 ones cut with a broader shoulder line, longer coat, and pleated trousers \u2014 or even casualwear from brands such as Aime Leon Dore (this is a very Gucci horsebit outfit).Since it\u2019s the original,the Gucci 1953is naturally the most iconic. It\u2019s the shoe that has been in the costume collection of New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum, Lisa Birnbach\u2019s 1980 tongue-in-cheek guideThe Official Preppy Handbook, and countless films and TV shows. But there are also many worthwhile alternatives, includingCarmina\u2019s 580746andAlden\u2019s Cape Cod.Jay Butler\u2019s Milbankis perhaps the most affordable of all. If you\u2019re buying something because you want a cheaper version of the Gucci, then you will end up being disappointed because it\u2019ll live in the shadow of the thing you want. But I think many of these other shoes are good on their own merits. Carmina\u2019s are lined in calfskin, rather than Gucci\u2019s use of canvas, while Alden\u2019s have a made-in-USA cred that will be important in trad circles. Buy the one that appeals most to you.Options:Gucci 1953,Carmina 580746,Carmina 80570,Jay Butler Milbank,Allen Edmonds Verona II,Beckett Simonon Beaumont,Oak Street Bootmakers, andAlden Cape CodThe Conservative Tassel LoaferA few years ago, I was hanging out with my friend Agyesh Madan, the owner and designer behind the Italian-inspired casualwear lineStoffa. That day, Agyesh wore a grey suede flight jacket, taupe cotton trousers, and a pair of blue suede Belgian loafers. Belgians aren\u2019t an easy style to pull off. They\u2019re a little dainty and ostentatious, with a ridiculous, miniature bow sitting on the vamp. You usually see them onwhite, upper-class preps hanging around the Hamptons(or, more likely, guys who like to affect the same pretenses). Agyesh can pull them off because he\u2019s anything but. As an Indian man with a scruffy beard, who wears leather jackets as part of his daily uniform, Agyesh says Belgians help soften his look.Which is how I feel about the question that gets asked every summer: \u201cAre tassel loafers only for old guys?\u201d The answer is yes, which is why anyone can wear them. Whether you\u2019re 30 or 60 years old, into traditional American style or something more contemporary, tassel loafers can work so long as you know how to incorporate them into your wardrobe. It\u2019s all about playing into or against the social stereotype.I fell in love with tassel loafers in much the same way that I fell in love with a lot of classic clothing: I got inspired by how other cultures adopted these items.I love how older Japanese guys in the tailoring industry wear tassel loafers, particularly those inspired by Italian men who copy British and American dressers.In this remixing of culture, you often see jaunty tassel loafers worn with soft-shouldered suits and sport coats, trad-y outfits involving Shetland sweaters, andeven a bit of workwear.For me,nothing beats Alden. Along with being the originator of this style, their tassel loafers have that perfect low-vamp shape and rounded toe box. This is the sort of shoe you see shuffling around dusty trad shops such asO\u2019Connell\u2019s. But there are also some other good contenders, such as the tassel loafers fromSid Mashburn,The Armoury, andRalph Lauren. Brown will always be your most versatile color, butblack tassel loafers are surprising chic and useful. You can wear them in any outfit where you can imagine wearing a black knit tie. They go with navy sport coats and grey trousers, brown tweeds paired with taupe whipcords, and any kind of suit.Options:Alden,Ralph Lauren Booth,Ralph Lauren Quillis,Allen Edmonds Grayson,Sid Mashburn,Carmina 80481,Edward Green Belgravia,The Armoury Hudson,Foster & Son Arlington,Morjas,Oak Street Bootmakers,TLB Mallorca Lancaster,Grant Stone,Barbanera,Shipton & Heneage Finchley,Meermin 101412, andMeermin 101381The \u201cPost Sneaker\u201d LoaferFor a small community of men online, there has been a lot of chatter lately about whether we\u2019re entering a \u201cpost sneaker world.\u201d This prophetic phrase, fueled by Lawrence Schlossman and James\u2019 Harris podcastThrowing Fits, suggests that some men are tired of entering and losing raffles for rare Nikes and subsequently paying inflated prices on the secondary market. They may also be looking to dress more appropriately for their age. As many move from shopping at Supreme to Aime Leon Dore, they\u2019re searching for shoes to match.Earlier this month,Jacob Gallagher of theWall Street Journalwrote about this section of \u201cvery tapped-in twenty- or thirtysomething consumers.\u201d \u201c[T]he Throwing Fits listeners and their cohort are not interested in tasteful yet generic Allen Edmonds, or the sort of safely somber Salvatore Ferragamo dress loafers you might have worn for decades. They\u2019re more intrigued by designs from upstart, mostly online-only brands that tweak loafers with aplomb.\u201dIt\u2019s difficult to describe the \u201cpost sneaker loafer,\u201d but as Gallagher notes, these are not your traditional styles. These companies mix elements from various designs, such as the chunky, 360-degree welt you might find on a country brogue with anunusually designed tassel loafer. Or acamp moc with a snaffle bit on the strap. Fundamentally, these are designed to be worn with slightly more fashion-forward outfits, such as the workwear style you might find atMonitalyorEngineered Garments.You can see how these outfits are put together inBlackstock & Weber\u2019s lookbook. The taupe, windowpane trousers, tan sweater, and long olive trenchcoat in the photo above is a reasonably classic outfit, but in a more modern color combination. It also looks great with the subtly updatedBlackstock & Weber spectator loafers, which have a chunkier silhouette than traditional varieties.Crockett & Jones\u2019 Crewe loaferlookstoorefined in comparison. I like Blackstock & Weber\u2019s Mason horsebit loafer the most.Available pebble grainorembossed croc, it\u2019s something you can wear with slim jeans andfuzzy mohair cardigans,camp collar shirts, oropen lace tops. \u201cThey\u2019re great if you like chunky shoes,\u201d saysNo Man Walks Alone\u2019sGreg Lellouche,who owns a pair in brown suede and with lug soles. \u201cI think of them more as aTimberland 3-eye lugthan a menswear loafer.\u201dOptions:Blackstock & Weber,Aime Leon Dore,Horatio,Vinny\u2019s, andYuketenFiled Under:Guides,Loafers,Shoes",

      "title": "The Seven-Shoe Wardrobe",
      "body": "The longer I write about men\u2019s clothing, the more disinclined I am to say what men should own. There\u2019s tremendous variation in classic men\u2019s style, and given that people live different lifestyles in different regions, it seems only the individual can say what\u2019s right for him.Still, I\u2019ve always found it interesting to read what others think comprises a basic wardrobe, and have found such articles incredible useful for my own wardrobe-building endeavors. So long as people use these as ways to think more deeply about what they should own, I think they have value.So, here\u2019s what I think makes up a basic shoe wardrobe. Seven shoes, designed for weekday and weekend wear.First are your \u201cformal\u201d shoes, which can be roughly divided into those with open lacing and those with closed. Closed laced shoes, otherwise known as balmorals or oxfords, have eyelet tabs that are sewn underneath the front part of the shoe. They\u2019re a bit more formal than open laced designs, which are also commonly known as derbys or bluchers.The black oxford:I think you should own at least one pair of black oxfords. You can buy these with punched decorations around the toe caps or go full brogue, but for the purposes of keeping to just seven shoes, I recommend a plain toe design or something with a smooth toe cap. These will be your most formal shoes and they can be worn with suits to weddings, funerals, and formal receptions. Even if you don\u2019t go to such things often, you will at some point, and you\u2019ll need appropriate footwear. Plus, asI\u2019ve written before, I think men should have a pair of black shoes for the evening. Black calf just gleams better at night.Two less formal dress shoes:Of course, few of us are in a position where we need to wear suits often. Most men wear sport jackets and odd trousers, if not something even more casual. For these purposes, you\u2019ll need two less formal dress shoes to rotate between during the workweek. There are a couple of options.The first are bluchers (open laced designs). Here the eyelet tabs are sewn on top of the front section of the shoe, making the foot less \u201cdressed up.\u201d For these, you can choose a plain toe design or something with a toe cap. Toe caps make the shoes slightly more informal, and something with decorative perforations around the edges of the cap is more informal still. For something truly informal, you can choose Norwegian split toes, like the pair pictured above, or wingtips, which have a rustic sensibility.Your other choice is to choose a brown oxford, which is more informal than black, and perhaps something in a casual material, such as suede. Like bluchers, these can have varying degrees of formality depending on the simplicity of the design. Toe caps and decorative perforations will always make a pair of shoes more informal, regardless if they\u2019re of open or closed lacing.I suggest that these two pairs be brown. Assuming you buy something of quality, brown develops a more interesting depth and richness than black. Plus, it arguably looks much better during the day. So now we have one pair of black oxfords for formal events and nighttime wear, and two pairs of brown dress shoes (either bluchers or a more casual oxford) for the workweek.The penny loafer:Now for the weekend. For spring and summer, I suggest slip-ons. There are a dozen variations \u2013 driving mocs, horsebit loafers, boat shoes, etc. For something truly basic, I suggest brown penny loafers. The penny loafer is thesine non-quashoe for post-war \u201cIvy Look,\u201d but they don\u2019t necessarily have to look Ivy or preppy. There are a dozen silhouettes these days to fit different styles, and a penny loafer can look as at home with a Continental look as it does with an American. Wear these with or without socks, depending on the weather and your style, but if you go without, be sure to knowhow to do it properly.The chukka boot:For fall and winter weekends, I recommend boots. Again, there are a dozen of variations. Balmoral boots are quite dressy, and something like a jodhpur is very casual and rustic. I think the most basic and easy-to-wear boot, however, is the chukka, sometimes also referred to as the ankle boot. In some areas of the world, it\u2019s acceptable to wear certain chukka boots with suits, but I think they\u2019re most safely worn as a leisure shoe. Pair them with jeans, moleskins, corduroys, or heavy woolen flannels, and anything as casual as a quilted jacket or waxed cotton coat, to something a bit dressier such as a tweed sports jacket.Sneakers:For near year-round casual wear, I also think you should own a pair of canvas sneakers \u2013 Chuck Taylors, Jack Purcells, Vans Authentics, Supergas, Spring Courts, and the like. These are a relatively cheap way to add another pair of shoes to your weekend rotation. Each retails for between $40 and $60, and can be had for a bit less if you wait for sales. Plus, white canvas sneakers can look more harmonious with certain casual outfits than leather shoes of any stripe.The seventh pair:The seventh pair will be up to you. If you live in a climate with harsh winters, perhaps you can pick up something from Jesse\u2019s listhere. If you live in warmer weather conditions, perhaps you\u2019d like a more interesting pair of slip-ons, such as monk straps or tassel loafers. The point here is to choose something according to your needs or whimsy, in addition to what I think are the bare basics above.And that\u2019s the seven-shoe wardrobe. Enough to get you through nearly any occasion on any day in any season, and with enough options to allow you to properly rotate through your shoes while not having so many pairs that anything will be neglected. This to me is a basic and well-rounded shoe collection.Filed Under:Guides,Shoes",

      "body": "Style is personal, very much connected to your lifestyle and personality. Which is why, even though we have some posts onhow to build a starting wardrobe, and suggestions forhow to dress for the office, we often shy away from listing things as \u201cessentials.\u201d In a recentVoguearticle, it was revealed that Prince had 3,000 pairs of bespoke shoes (3,000!!) \u2014 all in one style, glamorous four-inch heels, each custom made to fit his glam-god ensembles. You\u2019ll probably never find high heels listed as a menswear essential, but also no one more stylish than Prince.That said, I\u2019ve found I often reach of the same types of shoes everyday, and I\u2019d like to think my lifestyle is ateensy\u2013weensymore relatable than Prince\u2019s. And in my time reading menswear blogs and forums, it seems many guys find these same styles useful too. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re essentials \u2014 the best essentials, again,are found through trial-and-error. However, if you\u2019re just building a wardrobe, here are five styles that have worked for me. Maybe they\u2019ll also work for you.A Pair of Proper Dress Shoes: Norwegian Split ToesThe only real wardrobe essential we stand by is asincere suit, which also means you need its accouterments: a white dress shirt, dark silk tie, and a pair of proper dress shoes. Unless you wear a suit every day, however, you probably want to make those dress shoes derbies. Oxfords are too formal for sport coats and trousers \u2014 even worse with jeans. Derbies, on the other hand, span the gamut. They can be worn with tweeds and flannels; denim and knitwear; and (most) suits and ties. They don\u2019t look as sexy, but I find them infinitely more practical.When it comes to derbies, none make my heart pitter patter as much as the Norwegian split toe. It\u2019s true they can look a bit taxidermic. And if done poorly, an elongated toe seam can even seem phallic. When everything comes together well, however, nothing looks as good to me. Wingtips are too common; cap toes too plain. Norwegian split toes plant your feet in the ground and say you like something a little different.Style enthusiasts often considerEdward Green\u2019s Doverto be the Platonic ideal, but it\u2019s tremendously expensive. If you have this kind of money to spend,John Lobb\u2019s Harlynis also terrific. Both have those handsewn piecrust aprons and subtle toe seams that I think make this style look its best.For something more affordable, check intoAlden,Carmina, andCrockett & Jones. The last one has a slightly sportier style called theDurham, which rides the line between tailored clothing and casualwear, making it a bit more versatile.Enzo BonafeandVassoffer handwelted split toes;MeerminandCarlos Santosare solid budget-friendly options; andParaboot\u2019s Avignonis good if you want something distinctly casual (too informal for suits, but a solid choice with denim).Something Smart Casual: Penny LoafersThe penny loafer was thesine qua nonof the post-war Ivy Look. Often worn with Shetland sweaters, flat front chinos, and tweed sport coats, they were the choice of Ivy League students across the East Coast, later finding broader appeal throughEsquire. More than being an Ivy shoe, however, penny loafers embody the kind of casual, dressed-down style that the US has always championed (much like button-down collars, in that sense). In fact, that\u2019s what originally made them popular with students, who wanted something comfortable and smart, but sufficiently casual to avoid looking corporate.Which is why they continue to be so great today. They\u2019re dressier than sneakers, but not as formal as lace-up dress shoes. They go just as well with jeans and casual jackets as they do with sport coats and trousers. The Prince of Wales evenwears them with casual suits(although I don\u2019t recommend them with true business clothes). I wear mine three seasons out of the year, all but the coldest of days.Note, loafers come in a distinct range of formalities.Rancourt,Quoddy, andOak Street Bootmakers, for example, have rounder toe boxes, making them easier to wear with jeans, and aprons made with functional moccasin stitching. The design derives from the old Norwegian and American Weejun method of making loafers: two pieces of leather form the uppers (one for the plug and the other for the sides). They\u2019re then conjoined using a handsewn saddle stitch. If worn hard enough, that stitching will loosen up a little. Back in the day, students used to duct tape their penny loafers as they were falling apart, which for some was a mark of pride.Compare those against the more urbane loafers fromEdward Green,Carlos Santos,Meermin, andCarmina. Their toes are sleek and shapely; the apron is smoother and more refined. These can look more harmonious with casual suits and sport coats, but they can be too dressy for jeans or shorts. For something between these two worlds, tryAlden,JM Weston, andcertain loafers from Crockett & Jones(particularly the Boston and Harvard models). Those ride the line well between casual and formal, allowing you to switch between tailoring and jeans more easily.The Do It All: Textured ChukkasNo footwear style can do everything for you, but I find chukkas come close. They\u2019re an ankle-height boot that takes its name from a period of play in polo (although, like a lot of menswear history, stories are often mythical and muddled, and there\u2019s little evidence chukkas were actually worn for polo matches). Still, depending on their details, I find they go with nearly everything \u2014 casual suits, leather jackets, raw denim, casual trousers, and even fatigues. They straddle the line well in terms of formality.I like chukkas in a textured brown leather, such as a suede or pebble grain, which I find helps visually break up the vast expanse of material that stretches across the vamp and instep. If you get them with a studded Dainite rubber sole, they also work pretty well as rainboots (just treat the suede uppers with aweatherproof sprayand give pebble grains a quick brush down with awax polish).Unlike with split toes and penny loafers, there are often fewer details here to get wrong, which is good news if you\u2019re shopping on a budget. Affordable chukkas fromLoake,Herring, andMeermincan look just as nice as higher-end options fromAlden,Allen Edmonds,Enzo Bonafe, andVass(although Enzo Bonafe and Vass, being handwelted, are better built). Mine, pictured above, areCrockett & Jones\u2019 Brecon. Many of the usual suspects also have terrific chukkas \u2014Zonkey,Saint Crispins,Alfred Sargent,Edward Green, andCarmina. Unlined models can feel extra comfy in hot weather, but they\u2019ll lack the structure you may want for winter.For Real Casualwear: Simple, Mostly White SneakersIt\u2019s good to have a pair of authentically casual shoes, especially if you wear chinos or jeans. Typically this means sneakers \u2014 usually white, often simple. Sneakers can help an outfit feel a bit more relaxed and natural. You can even use them to dress down casual sport coats and tailored topcoats, although I find they still often look better with jeans than trousers.Some of my favorite sneakers these days includeVans slip-onsandMargiela\u2019s German Army Trainers. Plain white sneakers,a laCommon Projects, are nice but also a bit ubiquitous. Vans and GATs, on the other hand, have that casual feel that can feel better with sportier, relaxed clothes. I wear mine with camp collar shirts and jeans in the summer, or leather jackets come fall.Adidas also has their version of GATs at the moment, and they\u2019re a lot more affordable than Margiela\u2019s.Retro-style runners can also be great if you like\u201cRugged Ivy,\u201d a term for that period in the 1970s when Americans repurposed outdoor brands such as Sierra Designs and Eddie Bauer into their everyday attire. Think: 60/ 40 parkas, Levi\u2019s jeans, and Champion sweatshirts. I especially likeSpalwart\u2019s Marathon Lowsfor this sort of thing,but there are a ton of other options. Other solid sneakers includeChuck Taylors(I like thecushier 1970s version);Nike Air Force 1s(Common ProjectsandVorare great upscale-versions of the same design); andAdidas\u2019 Stan Smiths. Check oursneakers tagfor more suggestions.Your Experimental Pair: Side Zip BootsFinally, make your fifth pair personal, buy something unique. By experimenting with new things, you may find your wardrobe grows in unexpected directions \u2014 a pair of pants to go with some new shoes, then a jacket that you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever wear.My wardrobe has really grown in the last few years through my wearing of side-zips, which are close cousin of Chelseas and ropers. They\u2019re a slightly taller boot, usually six inches in height, and have a zipper on the medial part of the foot. Some are clean enough to go with minimalist styles such as those fromLemaire(one of my favorite designers at the moment); others are a bit more rugged and sit better with workwear.I love Margiela\u2019s zip boots for their silhouette. Over the years, they\u2019ve madesleeker designsand a chunkier, slightly square toe they call theirCampus. As it often goes with designer shoes, however, the quality leaves a lot to be desired. The leathers are often thin and treated; the soles glued on. Buying them in suede helps, but guys who are sticklers for quality may be left feeling cold.If quality is important to you, check outButteroandViberg. Buttero has lightweight, Blake stitched boots that work across a range of casualwear styles. Vibergs are a bit more rugged, but still reasonably versatile.Division Roadhas them in a beautifully rich Horween leather, Lampo zippers, and a Ridgeway sole with dropped midsole to keep them relatively elegant. Sizes are mostly sold out, but they\u2019ll restock soon (the boots picture above are the same boots, but aged).Luccheseis also a nice, slightly sleeker design. Just buy them in suede, as the smoother calfs can look artificial.TWLVseems good, although I wish they didn\u2019t burnish those toe boxes.Kapitalmakes some of my favorites, but they\u2019re hard to find outside of Japan (those are dyed with a fermented pomegranate juice that helps the uppers take on a unique color as they age). Lastly,Husbands Parislooks interesting if you like a more mid-century Mod look.Filed Under:Everyday Style,Shoes,Things We Love",

      "body": "In the last ten years, as men\u2019s style has grown and evolved, the idea of what it means to be well-dressed has become very personal, contextual, and even nebulous. People live different lives and have different needs.The only thing everyone really needs is a sincere suit. That\u2019s the suit you wear for when it matters: weddings, funerals, court appearances, job interviews, and other important occasions. Get one in a conservative style so you can wear it in five or ten years when this stuff comes up.There are some things that get pretty close to being essential. They tend to be garment care items because, whether you\u2019re in workwear, tailoring, or the avant-garde, everyone wants to take care of what they own (or they should). To be sure, this is still very contextual \u2014 we don\u2019t think you literally need everything on this list. But you may find these things handy.Your Most Basic Shoe CareIf you own shoes made fromfull-grain leather, you\u2019ll need some basic shoe care items, such as what you see above. This should include a bottle of leather conditioner. Leather can dry out and crack over time, so you need to nourish it every once in a while to keep it supple. We recommendBick 4orAllen Edmonds. Shoe nerds often recommendSaphir Renovateur, but the stuff is harsh and can strip the color off your shoes if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.Every basic shoe care kit should also include a bit of polish and a couple of brushes. Cream polish is useful for when you want a soft, matte finish, whereas wax is better for a higher gloss shine. Cream polish is also oilier than wax, so it helps nourish the leather, whereas wax helps build a superficial layer of protection. To apply the polish, get a dauber (a small brush). Then buy a larger horsehair brush to remove dush and build up a shine when necessary.Saphir is particularly good for polish, but you can buy brushes from your local cobbler for not much money.Related posts:A Complete A To Z Guide On Proper Shoe Care,Should You Use Cream Or Wax Polish For Shoes?,Building A Patina,Bulling Shoes,Five Tips For Better Shoe Polishing, andOur Webisode On ShoesFor Suede CareIt can be challenging to get stains out of suede. Things just cling to the hairy nap easily. So, to make your life easier, consider coating your suede shoes every once in a while with a waterproofing spray. This stuff is downright magical. It creates a billion microscopic filaments, which stand up on their ends. Whenever liquid hits the surface \u2014 say, spilled coffee, errant pizza drippings, or dirty roadside water \u2014the stuff just rolls right off. We recommend getting a spray that\u2019s made without any silicone, such asAllen Edmonds\u2019 Water Protector,Tarrago\u2019s Nano Protector, orSaphir\u2019s Super Invulner.For when stains do come up, make sure you have some tools handy.Baby powder is good for lifting out oil stains. You\u2019ll also want a suede-friendly shampoo ready, along with a gentle brush that won\u2019t take off too much of your nap.Attack the leather with a bit of this shampoo and scrub. We recommendSaphir\u2019s Omni\u2019Nettoyantfor these kinds of jobs. It\u2019s expensive, but it\u2019s surprisingly effective, will last for nearly forever, and it\u2019s cheaper than buying a brand new pair of shoes.Some guys also like having suede eraserson hand for spot cleaning. But as you can see above, between the suede shampoo and waterproofer, I\u2019ve hardly needed to use mine.Related posts:How To Clean Suede Shoes,Keeping Suede Shoes Clean This Winter,How Should You Protect Your Suede Shoes?, andPlease Mistreat Your Suede ShoesFor Sneakers Of All TypesThere was a time when cleaning your sneakers meant throwing them into the washer or attacking them with some random household cleaning agent (and praying your shoes didn\u2019t get ruined in the process). Nowadays, there are just as many specialized sneaker care products as there are for dress shoes. You can find cleaners, protectors, mesh bags, microfiber towels, traveling kits, quick wipes, restoration kits, and all sorts of other specialized products.The only thing you really need, however, is a cleaner. Years agoJason Markkpioneered this field by coming out with the first cleaning kit specially designed for just sneakers. Since then, their success has attracted a number of competitors. In a blind test,Crep Protectedged out Jason Markk inComplex\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Believe the Hype\u201d show. But their tests are a little more extreme than what you\u2019ll likely encounter in real life. In my experience, the two products perform similarly, and I tip it to Jason Markk for using less plastic packaging. Their cleaning kt is just $16 and it\u2019s good on everything from suede to leather to canvas (which is useful since sneakers are often made from a combination of materials). The brush is also gentle enough to use on the knitted mesh uppers of Nike\u2019s Flyknits.Related posts:Guide To Cleaning SneakersandHow to Clean SneakersShoe TreesAlways insert shoe trees into your shoes when you\u2019re not wearing them. They help minimize wrinkles, prevent the toes from curling up, and generally help maintain the shape of your shoes. Some companies, such as Edward Green, will have specialized shoe trees that are shaped according to the company\u2019s lasts (at Edward Green, it\u2019s their 202 and 606 last). Use these when you can. Otherwise, a pair ofWoodlores is fine.A Proper Shoe HornMost shoes are made with a stiff plastic heel counter. If you press your foot into the back of your shoes too hard and too often, you can crush that counter and make for a complicated and expensive repair job.To prevent this, always use a shoehorn when putting on shoes. If you don\u2019t have a shoehorn, you can still use something like a credit card to help slide your foot in (just place the credit card between your heel and the back of the shoe). But you know \u2026 a shoehorn can be had for aslittle as a couple of bucks. At some stores, such asShoeMart, they\u2019ll also include a free shoehorn with every purchase.Metal shoehorns are the most basic, and can be bought at any local shoe store or department store. If you want something that\u2019s a little nicer,Abbeyhorn sells some made from shaped oxhorn. Some likelonger shoehornsso they don\u2019t have to bend down as far. Personally, I find that since I have to bend down to tie my shoes anyway,a shorter 8\u2033 shoehornis more practical for when you\u2019re sitting down.Shaped Hangers for High-End TailoringI know what you\u2019re thinking: luxury hangers sound ridiculous. I thought the same for years until I spoke to a Savile Row tailor one day, who told me that improper hangers can actually ruin the shape of your suits and sport coats.Jeffery Diduch, Vice President of Technical Design at Hickey Freeman, wrote about this at his tailoring blog,Tutto Fatto a Mano. As he shows on his site, thinner wire hangers can push the sleeves of a coat outward, which ruins the shaping of the sleeve. If left hanging long enough, those creases eventually set in and it takes a skilled presser to get them out.Bespoke tailor Chris Despos also agrees.Over at StyleForum, he\u2019s noted how an improper hanger can distort and even stretch out the careful shaping that goes into a well-tailored jacket. That\u2019s why he prefersThe Hanger Project\u2019s hangers, which have a rounded neck, over the square-necked designs atButler Luxury. \u201cTailors cut their undercollars and collar linens on a bias, and they shape them to fit your neck,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe Hanger Project\u2019s hangers have a rounder shape at the collar, which is more representative of your actual neck and better for prolonged storage. Any square shaping at the neck can distort or even stretch out the collar.\u201dThe Hanger Projects\u2019 hangers, however, are expensive at about $28.Wooden Hanger USAis a lot more affordable at $7, but their hangers don\u2019t have that same forward pitch that mimics your posture (although, on the upside, that also means you can pack more into your closet). If the price is a concern, we recommendMainetti. They have more shaping than Wooden Hanger USA, although not as much as The Hanger Project. The neck is also square, and the hangers are made from a lightweight composite material, rather than solid wood. But they\u2019remore affordable at $86 for a pack of ten.Note, these types of hangers are only really necessary for high-end tailoring (and specifically suit jackets and sport coats). Casual jackets don\u2019t have the same three-dimensional shaping, so you can hang those on regular hangers.Related posts:A Tale Of Two HangersSweater CareIf you have a sweater, you\u2019ll need a sweater shaver, as every sweater pills. Pilling is a term for the fuzzy little balls that appear around areas of high-friction. Sweaters are made from yarns, and those yarns are made from fibers. When the fibers break, they tangle into each other and form something that looks like a mini-tumbleweed. Whether you buy your knits from high-street shops or luxurious boutiques, all sweaters pill eventually \u2014 the question is just how easily and by how much. And by safely getting rid of those pills, you can turn back the clock on your favorite knits, making them look like they were just bought yesterday.For years, we\u2019ve recommended sweater shavers for this. They\u2019re better than sweater stones or combs since they don\u2019t put in new breakages in the yarn. The best sweater shaver I\u2019ve found isactually a $12 model from Conair. You can buy fancier designs, such asSteamery for $50, but I find the differences to be more about aesthetics than performance. Conair\u2019s has an adjustable setting at the head, which allows you to set how closely the shaver sits on your knit. The shaver is also large and easy to handle, with a transparent and removable case to hold the lint. The only downside is that the build quality doesn\u2019t feel quite as robust, although I haven\u2019t had any problems mine. Steamery feels more substantial in hand, but it\u2019s more awkward to hold. It also has a USB charger, which just seems like a part you can lose.While you\u2019re at it, grab a bottle ofSoak(or some other \u201cno-rinse\u201d laundry detergent). Most sweaters have to be hand-washed. No-rinse detergents produce fewer suds, but they\u2019re no less effective than their counterparts. The only difference is that you then don\u2019t have to rinse out the suds, which significantly cuts down on your cleaning time.Related posts:I Dropped $100 On Sweater Shavers And Tested Each One So You Don\u2019t Have To,How To Get Rid of Pilling,The Best Knitwear Detergent, andHow To Wash A SweaterThe Amazing OxiCleanOxiclean is about as close as you get to a staple in the laundry room. It outperforms other top-selling stain removers, and it boosts colors while also making whites brighter. It\u2019s safe to use and doesn\u2019t leave any residue. For truly stubborn stains, you can add a couple of scoops of this stuff to a bucket. Then just add water and leave your garments to soak overnight. Your clothes will be almost brand new after you wash them the next day. This is the secret weapon of every vintage hunter and inveterate thrifter. It\u2019s a must if you get sweat stains easily or have kids who roll around in the grass.We\u2019ve been recommending it for years, and it\u2019s evenscience approved.Related posts:How To Really Clean A ShirtandThe Best Laundry Stain RemoverFiled Under:Care and Maintenance,Garment Care",

      "body": "So, I\u2019ve recently gotten into coffee and I spend an embarrassing amount of time online reading about different brewing methods, beans, and equipment. And as a relatively new convert, I\u2019ve found that the world of coffee enthusiasts isn\u2019t too different from the one that surrounds men\u2019s style. Some are passionate about their way of doing things and think everyone else should follow. Then there are those that are more measured, more thoughtful, and more catholic in their views. They\u2019ll say things such as \u201cit\u2019s all about what the person wants to achieve\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s all about taste.\u201d Which is absolutely true of everything that\u2019s inherently subjective, but \u2026 it\u2019s not very helpful advice to beginners.This is partly why posts about \u201cmenswear essentials\u201d are so terrible. Assuming they\u2019re not advertorials (which we never do), they\u2019re often too constraining and dictatorial.Ten Things Every Man Must Own! The Correct Way to Wear This Item!In reality, as people develop their own personal sense of style,they\u2019ll find their own essentials\u2014 things that often will never make it onto such lists or even be useful to other people. But if you\u2019re just starting out, you may not have a very good sense of personal taste or even aesthetic direction. So, it can be useful for someone to lead you through some of the most basic purchases, even if they\u2019re only a springboard for you to explore other areas.So, here\u2019s our list of \u201cmenswear essentials\u201d with some caveats. We\u2019ve gone through and listed things we think would be a solid, starting wardrobe, as well as reasons for why we think each item is useful. Each section has a list of links for further reading. Many of the things on this list are good basics that can stay with you for years, even as you explore other areas and develop your own sense of personal style. You don\u2019t need to own everything on this list, but at least you can go into the wardrobe building process with some suggestions.THE ONE ACTUAL ESSENTIALThe Sincere Suit:Truthfully, there\u2019s only one real wardrobe essential. No matter your background or lifestyle, you need a sincere suit \u2014 something to wear to serious occasions. Weddings, funerals, christenings, court appearances, big meetings, or job interviews.As Jesse once put it, \u201ceven professional surfers who live in beach huts in Bali have great-uncles who die back in Fresno. And great-aunts who\u2019d feel bad if their grand-nephew showed up to the funeral in khakis and a polo shirt.\u201dThe thing is, getting a good suit takes time. You don\u2019t want to shop for one at the last minute, otherwise you\u2019ll be forced to drop $500 on something that doesn\u2019t look quite right and you don\u2019t love. So start shopping for a sincere suit now, well before you actually need one.We recommend getting something conservatively styled, in a single-breasted configuration with notch lapels and made from a dark gray or navy wool. Something that you\u2019ll still be happy to wear in ten or fifteen years. For people who don\u2019t wear suits often,you can also try to find a suit that can be broken into separates. That way, the jacket can do double-duty as a sport coat when you need (although, you\u2019ll want to make sure the wool isn\u2019t too shiny, which will give up the game).Related posts:You Need a Sincere Suit;What Should You Get for Your First Suit?,A Japanese Guide on How a Suit Should Fit, andSuggestions for Where to Look for a Suit Parts OneandTwoSo now you have your sincere suit, you need some things to go along with it. A rundown of the accouterments:White Dress Shirt:The plain white dress shirt is the foundation of a more formal suit-and-tie outfit. Something made from a smooth, plain fabric such as poplin, cut with a semi-spread collar that\u2019s large enough to take a necktie (avoid skimpy collars). The key here is all in the fit. In one of our webisodes,you can see Carl from CEGO Custom Shirtmakers run through some of the basics of how a shirt should fit.Dark Necktie:If you only own necktie, make it a black or navy silk grenadine. The texture adds visual interest to plainer ensembles, while the solid color makes this an easy pairing with patterned jackets and shirts. If you want to expand your wardrobe later, you can get some rep stripes and subtly patterned grey ties \u2014 say, black and white glen plaids \u2014 to supplement. Discretely patterned gray ties are great for formal occasions, and they pair well with navy.White Linen Pocket Square:A pocket square is the easiest and most affordable way to improve the look of a suit or sport coat. Pick a crisp, white linen pocket square to start, which you can wear in theTV or Presidential fold. Its simplicity makes it easy to wear with almost any tailored jacket. When choosing one, get something with plump, handrolled edges (we sell some). It\u2019s a small detail, but it helps separate the square from those with flat machine-sewn edges, which often look cheap.Dress Shoes: If you think you\u2019ll be wearing suits often, nothing beats a pair ofblack or dark brown oxfords. They\u2019re sleek, sophisticated, and the only acceptable dress shoe in some circles. However, if you know you\u2019ll rarely wear a suit,consider going for a derby instead. Their open-lacing makes them look a bit more casual \u2014 and thus less refined with a suit \u2014 but at least your shoes won\u2019t be collecting dust for most of the year.Belt and Socks:Finally, if your suit pants have belt loops, you\u2019ll want a leather dress belt that approximately matches the color of your shoes (dark brown with dark brown, black with black). Socks should be solid navy and over-the-calf. Nobody wants to see your bare calves when you sit down in a suit.BASIC BUSINESS CASUALNavy Sport Coat:In today\u2019s dressed down world, a navy sport coat is a great way to get the smart look of tailoring without the stuffiness of a gray flannel suit. This is the jacket you can wear on date nights or for meeting colleagues on the weekend. It\u2019s the jacket that will make mom proud on Mother\u2019s Day. Or the jacket you can bring with you when traveling and be prepared for almost anything \u2014 nights outs, dinner parties, or (most) business meetings. It\u2019s hard to overstate the usefulness of a proper navy sport coat.Get something classic. Softly tailored, single breasted, and made with notch lapels. Nothing too skimpy or full, and made with brown horn buttons instead of brass (the second can be charming, but also make you look like you belong to a yacht club). Most of all, try to get a jacket made from a slightly more textured wool, such as serge or hopsack. This will help distinguish it from slightly more formal suit jackets.Related posts:Your Second Sport Coat Should be Brown,How a Sport Coat Should Fit, andSuggestions for Where to Look for a Suit Parts OneandTwo(the same places sell sport coats)Gray Wool Trousers:Gray trousers are the backbone of tailored wardrobe \u2014 so much so that you should pause before buying anything that can\u2019t be worn with them. The reason is simple. Gray as a color visually fades into the background, allowing the focus to be on your shirt, tie, and jacket combination (which is where you want it). Light and mid-gray will be your most versatile shades; charcoal less so because it often doesn\u2019t lend enough contrast to darker colored jackets. Get a pair in flannel wool, then some subtle weaves such as whipcord and pick-and-pick. If you\u2019re looking to expand your trouser wardrobe later, start with tan. It\u2019s a slightly more casual color, but just as versatile. For now, we recommend sticking to solid colors. Patterned trousers, especially for a more classic and tailored wardrobe, can be difficult to wear.Related posts:The Importance of Gray Pants,Sport Coat and Trouser Combinations,Charcoal Pants Aren\u2019t That Useful,Three Types of Chinos,How Useful are Navy Trousers?,Jeans That Can be Worn with Sport Coats, andHow Tailored Trousers Should FitOxford Cloth Button Downs (aka OCBDs):Over the years, the OCBD has become something of a symbol of all that is good \u2014 casualness, youth, education, trustworthiness, dependability, sport, and professionalism. They\u2019re something a man can wear in the country or city, in sport or business, on weekdays or weekends. And next to jeans, they\u2019re arguably America\u2019s best contribution to men\u2019s style.The thing that makes the OCBD so great is its versatility. The collar is formal enough to take a tie, but also stands up straight when worn open. The fabric is fine for a dress shirt, but also hefty and textured enough for casualwear. For guys just starting to build a wardrobe, these can be a great springboard allowing you to explore different styles without having to constantly reinvent your shirt wardrobe. Get them in solid blue, solid white, and some basic blue/ white stripes (although mostly solid blue).Related posts:How a Shirt Should Fit,A Custom Shirtmaker on the Basics of Fit,The Importance of White and Light Blue Shirts,Sit Down in Your Shirts,How to Wear a White Shirt,Better Ways to Wear a White Shirt,Thoughts on Basic Shirt Wardrobe, andour Oxford-Cloth Button-Down SeriesLess Formal Dress Shoes:Oxfords can be too formal for anything less than a dark business suit, so you\u2019ll want dress shoes that ride the line between sneakers and business wear. A classic pair of derbies can be worn almost year round with any sport coat ensemble \u2014 plain toe, cap toe, wingtip, or my favorite, thesplit-toe Norwegian. Pebble grained or sueded chukkas can also be wonderful for the fall and winter months; plain calfskin penny loafers are often better suited to spring/ summer. Explore a little here and chose something that feels right for your climate, lifestyle, and personality.Ideally, you should buy at least two pairs of shoes and rotate, so that you never wear the same pair two days in a row. This gives your shoes enough time to properly dry, otherwise the sweat from your feet can prematurely break down the leather. Also, pick up some leather conditioner, shoe polish, shoe trees (preferably made from cedar), and a horsehair brush.You\u2019ll need these to take care of your shoes.Related posts:Figure Out Your Brannock Size,How to Know When Your Shoes Fit,The Seven Shoe Wardrobe,A Cautionary Tale About Leather,Some Shoe Terminology,Where to Find Affordable Shoes,What Shoe Care Products Should You Consider?,Should You Use Cream or Wax Polish,The Single Most Important Shoe Care Tip, andOur Webisode on ShoesBASIC WEEKEND CASUALRaw Denim Jeans:Jeans are the cornerstone of a casual wardrobe, and raw denim is often favored because of how the denim naturally fades and breaks in over time. Even with the best manufacturing technologies today, pre-faded or distressed denim simply never looks as good as the real thing. And so long as you\u2019re willing to put up with the initial stiffness of raw denim, they\u2019ll look better and better as they age \u2014 like many other kinds of good clothes.Getting the right pair, however, can be challenging. For guys just starting to build a wardrobe, we recommend starting with a pair in a slim-straight cut. These flatter most builds and are generally easier to wear across a range of casualwear styles \u2014 useful as you\u2019re experimenting with different things and finding your own sense of style. A mid-weight denim around 12/13oz will also be crunchy enough to give you some interesting fades over time without feeling like you\u2019re wearing armor at first. Just know the indigo is going to bleed a bit for the first few dozen wears, so don\u2019t sit down on any white couches. Again, the charm is all in how raw denim naturally fades over time.Related posts:Kiya Babzani of Self Edge on Common Denim Myths Part OneandTwo,The Whats and Whys of Unsanforized Denim,How to Repair Jeans,What is Selvedge Denim?,The Meaning of Selvedge Then and Now,Our Webisode on Denim, andThe T-Shirt OutfitCotton Chinos:Chinos are not just chinos. Though they\u2019re always casual, they come in different flavors of informality, so it\u2019s good to be sensitive to these differences. Some have a rugged workwear sensibility, some feel dressy and tailored, and others sit between these two worlds. Pay attention to how the side seams look. Washed, garment dyed chinos, for example, will have a bit more detailing in a way that very dressy chinos may not (the more variation you see in the coloring and stitching, the more casual the look).See this post for a fuller explanation on how to spot these differences. When getting a pair, khaki will often be your most useful color, but olive can be great as well.Related posts:The Three Types of ChinosandThe T-Shirt OutfitGood Knitwear:Plain and solid-colored sweaters, such as the merino or cashmere v-necks you can find in almost every department store nowadays, can be fine for dressier occasions. But if you\u2019re planning to mostly wear this casually, aim for something textured, such as a cabled knit, Aran, or something made from a coarser fiber such as Shetland or lambswool. These will give the sweater a bit more surface interest, making them look better under a coat or even on their own. And while sweats have been derided for years as looking sloppy and ill-considered, almost everyone can use a solid gray cotton sweatshirt. It\u2019s sporty, rugged, easy to maintain, and looks great under casual outerwear. We favor ones with a v-shaped gusset at the neck \u2014 an vintage detailing that sets these apart from cheaper sweats.Related posts:Two Types of Sweaters,Five Suggestions for How to Buy Better Knitwear,How to Wash a Sweater,How to Take Care of Sweaters,The Best Knitwear Detergent,How to Find Good Cashmere, and then category posts onSweatshirts,Arans,Shetlands, andCamberButton Up Shirts:We\u2019re big fans of the plain white t-shirt here at Put This On,and even have a post talking about how they can be best worn. For guys who are just starting to build a wardrobe, however, you probably need fewer t-shirts and more button-ups. A collar is just a great way to frame the face \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t have to look dressy. Try the oxford-cloth button-downs we mentioned above to start. Again, those are a great springboard for you to explore other styles while not having to constantly reinvent your shirt wardrobe. Other great options include linens, madras, plaid flannels, and chambrays. Ditch the graphic tees (for now).Related posts:How a Shirt Should Fit,A Custom Shirtmaker on the Basics of Fit,The Importance of White and Light Blue Shirts,Sit Down in Your Shirts,Our Oxford-Cloth Button-Down Series,A Guide to Summer Shirts,A Guide to Fall Shirts Parts OneandTwoBetter Leather Shoes:Good style often starts from the bottom, which means it\u2019s hard to look well dressed without a great pair of shoes. Part of this is about knowing how to spot quality. At the very least,avoid cheap looking leathers. The second is about figuring out which styles best suit your ideal wardrobe. It\u2019s hard to narrow things down here to a practical list, as casualwear can be so varied,but Jesse\u2019s post is terrific. It\u2019ll guide you through some basics, such as chukkas, camp mocs, plain toe bluchers, country brogues, work boots, and Chelsea boots. All these sit in the middle of the spectrum in terms of formality \u2014 a bit better looking than gym shoes, but not as formal as oxford lace-ups.Again, buy two pairs so you\u2019re not wearing the same shoes two days in a row. This gives your shoes time to properly dry out, otherwise your sweat can prematurely break down the leather.You\u2019ll also want to pick up some basic shoe care supplies. Leather shoes are expensive, so you\u2019ll want to take care of them.Related Posts:Ten In-Between Shoes,The Very Useful Work Boot,Figure Out Your Brannock Size,How to Know When Your Shoes Fit,Some Shoe Terminology,A Cautionary Tale About Leather,What Shoe Care Products Should You Consider?,Should You Use Cream or Wax Polish,The Single Most Important Shoe Care Tip, andOur Webisode on ShoesPlain White Sneakers:White sneakers can look more harmonious with certain casual outfits than brown leather shoes of any stripe. For something cheap and basic, start with a pair made from cotton canvas \u2014 Chuck Taylors, Jack Purcells, Vans Authentics, Supergas, or Spring Courts. These can often be had for less than $50. If you have a bit more money to spend, you can go for more refined looking, plain white leather sneakers (a la Common Projects and their many copycats). Adidas\u2019 Stan Smiths andRod Laversare also great. And we\u2019re big fans ofGerman Army Trainers(the model for many classic sneaker designs today). Again, a great way to add another option to your casual footwear rotation.Related posts:Alternatives to Common Projects,Adidas\u2019 Other Tennis Shoe,The German Army Trainer,Adidas is Coming Out with GATs, andHow to Clean SneakersThree Casual Jackets:This is the fun stuff. A coat can really make an outfit, which iswhy it\u2019s often worth spending a little more in this category. That said, unless you\u2019re made of money, everything above will likely leave you with little left for a good jacket (and you\u2019ll want more than one). So to start, consider something vintage, maybe bought at a thrift shop or local surplus store.Pea coatsandmilitary field jacketscan be great in this regard. eBay is also full of duffle coats from well-regarded brands such as Gloverall, Montgomery, Ralph Lauren, and Brooks Brothers. Expect these to run you about $100.If vintage doesn\u2019t appeal, we have atwo-part series on outerwearthat won\u2019t break the bank. Shops such asClub MonacoandJ. Crewcan also be great for contemporary styled options under $200 (buy on sale).Our eBay roundupsandGrailedare also great resources.Experiment here. Dig into things that give you style inspiration, whether they be films, art, music subcultures, historical movements, designer lookbooks, or anything else. Invest as much as you can into your outerwear, and be prepared for a bit of turnaround \u2014 buying and reselling things as you find new items that appeal to you. The good news is that, compared to other things on this list (e.g. shirts and pants), the value of outerwear often steadily holds at about 25-50% of retail, so you can recoup most of your money if you buy on sale or shop second-hand.If I were forced to make suggestions to someone just starting out, I say pick up anolive-colored M-65 style army jacket(or its various iterations). Then aheavy topcoatthat at least reaches the knees, perhaps also aBarbour(the waxed cotton can double as a light rain jacket). These three should cover you for almost any kind of weather.Related posts:A Buyer\u2019s Guide to Barbour,Options for Affordable Outerwear Parts OneandTwo,Nothing More Classic Than a Peacoat,Splurge a Little On Outerwear, andField Guide to Field JacketsFiled Under:Best Of,Guides,Wardrobe Building",

      "title": "A Basic Guide On Alterations",
      "body": "The easiest way to improve your wardrobe is to take things to the alterations tailor. Since clothes are designed for an idealized body, they often fit everyone and no one in particular at the same time. That means you can often improve the look of your clothes by having things nipped and tucked here and there \u2014 taking in the waist or shortening the sleeves, adjusting the length of your trousers so they fall perfectly over your shoes. For a few bucks, you can get off-the-rack clothes that look 90% on their way to being custom made.We\u2019ve written dozens of guides on alterations. And while it would be too much to include everything you ought to know in one post, we thought we\u2019d gather the basics into a simplified guide, then include some links to suggested readings from our archive. Pair this with ourservice directory on how to take care of your clothesand you\u2019ll have most of your clothing services covered.HOW TO FIND A QUALITY LOCAL TAILORTailors are a bit like barbers. It can take a bit of work to find a good one, and once you do, you should hold on to them for dear life. The quality of your alterations depends on the quality of your tailor \u2014 and finding one in your area isn\u2019t always easy. Here are three ways you can go about it:If you live in a big US city, search clothing boards such asStyleForum,Reddit\u2019s Male Fashion Advice, andAsk Andy About Clothes.Denizens there are often a bit more discerning than most when it comes to quality tailoring, and they\u2019ll be able to point you in the right direction. The downside? Since most members are based in major US cities, you\u2019re more likely to find suggestions if you live in or around a major cosmopolitan center. If you don\u2019t, you may need to try some other strategy.Another way is to search for recommendations through local upscale establishments.These can be anything from small, independent menswear boutiques carrying brands you admire to large department stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. Or they could be single brand shops such as Ralph Lauren or Tom Ford flagships. They may also be high-end hotels, such as the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton.Ask the managers there if they have suggestions. Some clothing stores have in-house tailors they rely on for alterations, but many will send out work to a local shop. Others, such as hotels, may just be plugged into the local network for high-end services. Call a few places, ask for recommendations, and see if one or two names keep popping up. If you can narrow in on a consensus among some trusted sources, it\u2019s likely those places do good work.Failing that, there\u2019s always Yelp.Yelp reviewers aren\u2019t always the most reliable, and just because a place is rated well doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s good. But trawling Yelp for recommendations will be better than just venturing out on your own. Hedge your bets with a new shop by sending in something inconsequential or easy \u2014 say, hemming a pair of cheap chinos or altering an affordable button-up. Once you\u2019ve established they do reliable work, you can slowly move your way up to more complicated jobs. Don\u2019t throw in all your chips at once. Save major surgery jobs for when you\u2019ve confirmed the tailor is good.FURTHER READING:Q & Answer, How to Find a Good TailorandA Three Step Process to Finding Quality Tailors and Dry CleanersKNOW WHAT CAN BE ALTEREDLet\u2019s start with this: almost any alteration can be done, it just depends on how much you\u2019re willing to pay. At a certain point, the job becomes so complicated and expensive, you\u2019re better off finding something better off-the-rack. This is the difference between converting a car into a drop-top convertible and just buying that convertible outright. Sometimes it\u2019s better to just purchase the thing you want and adjust at the margins.Figuring out what can be altered heavily depends on a case-by-case basis. There aren\u2019t any hard and fast rules here, but there are some basic principals you may want to consider.The more complicated the alterations or garment, the more expensive the job.Again, it\u2019s good to keep costs in mind here. Suit jackets and sport coats are more complicated to alter than shirts, and thus alterations are more expensive. Similarly, if a casual jacket has some unusual, hard-to-modify details \u2014 such as a leather jacket with unusually placed studs \u2014 it may be difficult to work around those parameters. When judging something off the rack, take into account the extremity of the alteration needed, where the alteration needs to take place, and the complexity of the garment\u2019s construction. All of these will factor into your costs.Make sure the garment fits in certain places.You generally want certain areas to fit perfectly off-the-rack. Jackets, shirts, and sweaters, for example, ought to fit perfectly through the chest and shoulders at the outset. If the chest and shoulders don\u2019t fit right from the get-go, put the item back. Similarly, trousers should fit well through the thighs and seat. Getting those areas altered can be difficult, if not impossible.What are some common alterations?Some alterations are so common, you almost don\u2019t even need to think about them. Suit jackets and sport coats often have a bit of a roll between the shoulder blades, which can be taken out for cheap. Sleeves are commonly taken up (although the job can be a little more difficult with working buttonholes). The waist on shirts and jackets are often nipped; trousers are frequently always hemmed; and the waistband on pants can be taken in or let out within reason. You can also taper trousers and jeans from the knee down, giving them a bit more shape.See this post for a list of common alterations.Consider the material.Wool garments can sometimes be easier to alter, especially if you\u2019re looking to let out things, because the surface nap covers up any holes. Crisp linens, fine cottons, and especially leather, however, will leave visible holes.Changing details.Often, we\u2019ll get an email from a reader asking if certain details can be altered on a garment.Whether a structured shoulder can be changed into a soft one, or a roped shoulder modified into something more natural looking.Or whether a wide lapel can be changed into something more modest. The answer is often yes, but it\u2019s risky, expensive, and not worth it. Typically, you\u2019ll end up with something that costs a lot of money and still doesn\u2019t look quite right. Stick to simpler jobs.The one exception is taking out the lining in a jacket, at least through the back.It\u2019s easier to take things in than let things out.The reason is because, in order to let out a garment, you need enough material inside (what tailors call a seam allowance). Most companies don\u2019t build in that much seam allowance, however, because doing so costs money. So, if you\u2019re shopping off-the-rack and something feels a bit tight, your best bet is often to just size up.See this post on our guide for letting out clothes.Can This Be Altered?The answer is almost always yes, yes, and yes. But not all tailors have the equipment or skills necessary to do every job, so sometimes you need to find a specialist. See these posts for how to alterleather jackets,sweaters, andneckties(your local alterations shop can likely take care of the rest).FURTHER READING:Common Alterations;How Much Should Suit Alterations Cost?;Can Leather Jackets,Knitwear, andTies Be Altered?;Removing the Lining From a Jacket;How to Eliminate Blousing on a Shirt;How Long Should a Suit Jacket or Sport Coat Be?;andYes, You Can Shorten Shirt TailsPAY ATTENTION TO CERTAIN AREASWhen it comes to getting good alterations, half the battle is finding a good tailor. The other half is having a good eye. While you should always rely on your tailor\u2019s advice, you should also pay attention to some key areas:Collar Gap:This is numero uno when it comes to making sure your garment fits well \u2014 particularly for suits and sport coats, but also casualwear. With few exceptions, such as mountain parkas, all jackets should stay glued onto your neck, even when you\u2019re moving around (again, within reason). A collar gap is when the jacket hovers from your neck, suggesting that maybe the cut and fit aren\u2019t quite right (see above).Jesse wrote an excellent explainer a few years ago.Unfortunately, it\u2019s not clear whether a collar gap can be fixed. \u201cA lot depends on the exact cause, the severity, and the make of the jacket,\u201d saysChris Despos, a bespoke tailor in Chicago. \u201cIf the shoulders need to be squared up, there\u2019s only so much you can do before you cause other kinds of issues. If the back needs to be shifted, you\u2019re limited by how much extra cloth is available at the hem. It\u2019s hard to diagnosis these things without seeing a client in person.\u201d Your best bet, says Chris, is to take things into a local alterations tailor and be prepared to return the garment if things don\u2019t work out.Shoulder Divot:The dreaded shoulder divot was once the mark of pure shame on clothing boards. And it\u2019s still one of the most common fit defects on suits and sport coats. The term refers to the small indentation that can happen on the upper part of the sleeveheads, which ruins the otherwise clean line running down from the jacket\u2019s shoulder and into the sleeves (see the photo above).People often think this happens because the shoulders are too wide, but it\u2019s actually the opposite. While shoulder divots can occur from poor workmanship or design, they\u2019re often because the jacket\u2019s shoulders aretoo narrow for the wearer.You can get this fixed at a local alterations tailor, but the job is often complicated, expensive, and can cause other issues (letting the jacket out along the back seam, for example, can cause mismatched patterns). Instead, just size up.Tutto Fatto a Mano has a great post about this.Sleeve Pitch:For suits and sport coats, sometimes the sleeves don\u2019t hang smoothly because their rotation \u2014 or pitch \u2014 don\u2019t match the natural pitch of your arms. So, when you\u2019re standing naturally, if your arm is a little too pushed back or forward, it can cause wrinkling along the front or back of the sleeve.A StyleForum member once put together a nice little illustration showing this effect. The good news is that a tailor can usually alter this for you.The Back of Trousers:When you\u2019re at your tailor\u2019s, utilize that three-way mirror and see how your trousers hang from the back \u2014 it\u2019s one of the easiest things to miss. You can always see how trousers hang from the front, but it\u2019s often the seat and the backs of the legs that have issues. These areas should drape cleanly,like you see here on Panta\u2019s custom-made trousers. To be sure, you probably can\u2019t get something to fit that exact off-the-rack, but it\u2019s better to be closer to the ideal than not. The good news is that these issues can sometimes be adjusted by a local alterations tailor, but a lot depends on the exact cause of the problems, the severity of the issues, and the make of the garment (much like a coat\u2019s collar gap).See our post on common fit issues with trousers.Cuffs and Breaks:If you\u2019re sending in pants, decide beforehand how you feel about cuffs and breaks. Whether you cuff your trousers is a personal choice, although they should be left off the most formal of suits, such as tuxedos.We have a full guide on cuffs here.Breaks, on the other hand, are a bit more by-the-rules. The break of your trousers is where the hem touches the shoes, and unless you\u2019re wearing something fashion forward oravant-garde, you should avoid things that are either pooling around your ankles or cropped. Instead, go for either a full break, slight break, or no break at all \u2014 but make sure the hem of your pants are still touching the shoes.Again, we have a full guide on breaks here.Darting Shirts:One of the most common alterations jobs is slimming down a shirt. And depending on your body, you may find that you can\u2019t get as much out as you want through the side seams alone. In such cases, you can consider darting the back. You can see an example of a darted shirt above (the faint lines near the sides of the shirt are darts).Darts are folds that have been pinched and then sewn into a garment. They\u2019re basically a way to add shape \u2013 turning a flat piece of cloth into something with curves. When put into the back of a shirt, they do two things. First, they\u2019ll take out the fullness at the lower back, helping reveal that hollowed shape. As a result, you\u2019ll have a bit more of a sculpted look. Second, they\u2019ll help slim down the shirt when the tailor can\u2019t take any more out of the side seams.See here for our full guide on darting shirts. (Pro tip: Tutto Fatto a Mano has acool post here about darting jeans so they better cover a prominent seat. Maybe something your local tailor can also do for you).FURTHER READING:Can a Collar Gap be Fixed?;The Details of Sleeve Pitch;Deciding Whether Your Trousers Should be Cuffed;How Much Should My Trousers Break;The Difference Between Darts and Side Seams on Shirts; andHow to Eliminate Blousing on a ShirtSOME GENERAL TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL ALTERATIONSRely On Your Tailor\u2019s Advice.Don\u2019t micromanage the process too much. If you get a good tailor, he or she should be able to guide you towards better decisions. Rely on them for their advice. They\u2019re the professional, after all.Pay Attention to Fit.With that said, the tailor isn\u2019t here to style you. Go into this process with an eye for how you\u2019d like clothes to fit (we have tons of guides). You should also decide on things such as cuffing and breaks, as mentioned above. And be wary of going too slim. A tailor can always take in a garment, at least as much as your body will allow, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll look good. Getting clothes slimmed down too much is the most common mistake of new and overeager customers.Take Things Slowly.Can\u2019t decide between cuffing and not cuffing trousers? When in doubt, always cuff. Because while you can always remove them, you can\u2019t put cuffs into trousers if there\u2019s not enough material. Similarly, if you\u2019re unsure about a certain alteration, err on the side of caution. Certain things can\u2019t be reversed, so try living with a detail or cut for a while before deciding how you feel about it.Wear the Right Clothes.When bringing things to your tailor, you\u2019ll typically try on the garment in front of them, so he or she can pin and chalk things at the right places. That means you should be wearing the kind of clothes you plan to wear with the item. So, if you\u2019re bringing in a suit, arrive in your dress shoes and dress shirt. If you\u2019re sending in a casual coat, bring along a sweater. This way, you and your tailor can get a better sense of what needs to be done in order to get these outfits to look right.Account for Movement.Don\u2019t forget to account for movement. Shirt sleeves should be long enough so that the cuff stays at your wrist when you move your arms. Linen garments wrinkle, which means it\u2019s ok for sleeves and trousers to be a little longer than usual \u2014 they\u2019ll come up to the right length once you wear them for a few hours. And trousers ride up a bit when you walk, so be careful of getting things too short. Otherwise, too much of your ankle will show when you hit your stride or sit down.The Makeshift Shoe Horn.Sometimes, when changing in and out of pants, your tailor may not have a shoehorn. In these cases, use something like your credit card. A thick plastic card, when placed between your heel and shoe, basically does the same trick.THE TAILORS WE USEPut This On\u2019s team is spread across five cities, so we thought we\u2019d put together a list of the tailors we use.

      "body": "Mitchell Moss in a sportcoat and flannel trousers from Natalino.In a clip on her Netflix series \u201cPretend It\u2019s a City,\u201d writer (and proudAnderson and Sheppard customer) Fran Lebowitz is asked whether she attributes her sense of humor to nature or nurture. Fran replies, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much nurture of it, I assure you.\u201d Lebowitz means she wasn\u2019t encouraged to be funny; that growing up in the 1960s, being funny wasn\u2019t a character trait society wanted in a woman. Of course, she built her career (and, eventually, paid for those A&S jackets) by being funny, acerbic, and amusingly cranky.Some people may be born with a sense of style \u2014 for the rest of us, though, style can, in fact, be nurtured. Developing yours, and building a wardrobe, can be daunting, and even discouraging, especially when we first start out. First of all, most of us can\u2019t go to Anderson and Sheppard and rely on their guidance (or ignore it, as Lebowitz has on occasion). We rely on guideposts of style we want to emulate: whether that\u2019s parents, characters in literature or film, magazines, websites, Instagram.Many resources (including this one) will advise you to focus on basics \u2014 navy jackets and suits, white or blue shirts, gray flannel or khaki cotton trousers, decent lace-up shoes, and versatile accessories. Evenpost-dress-codes, these items will serve you well in many situations, sort of like a decent sense of humor.Mitchell Moss, an editor in the Nashville area, is an excellent style guidepost. He sets a really useful and accessible example of finding a lot of range in tailored clothing without going full Pitti Uomo (even though Mitchell has, in fact, been to Pitti Uomo). Mitchell has a tremendously consistent style, taking advantage of some core colors and silhouettes. Much of his wardrobe uses blues, grays, browns, and other neutrals, with shirts almost exclusively in the blue family. He also relies on makers that allow him to blend Italian and European influences (soft tailoring, print scarves, suede footwear) with American style (denim-adjacent shirts,five-pocket pants).At first, that could sound limiting, but Mitchell\u2019s combinations are interesting in part because he doesn\u2019t necessarily make the easy choice for each piece. Rather than ten blue oxford OCBDs, he has a number of different stripes and denim/chambray, as well as a handful of collar styles, all of which are reasonably classic. He\u2019s not a Batman\u2019s-closet sort of dresser, with a rack of the same garments, but his tailored outfits are recognizably his.As a dad of young kids, I can say the fact that Mitchell continues to build an interesting tailored wardrobe with a growing family at home (and during a pandemic) is even more impressive. HisblogandInstagramare also great examples because photos are clear and well-lit, attributable to the photographer\u2019s skills \u2014 Mitchell\u2019s wife, Dana Moss.Mitchell told me his approach to clothes is that they should make you look good, feel cool, and express your personality/personal style at some level. \u201cTailoring is great for #1 without a doubt; it can definitely do #2, but it\u2019s not without its pitfalls there; and for #3, that\u2019s up to you.\u201dHis three key tips for guys starting out in tailoring:Focus on finding a tailoring style that is flattering to your body typeDress for yourself, but be honest about the circumstances you\u2019re inDon\u2019t let the enthusiasts ruin your enthusiasmAccording to Mitchell, \u201cThe rage is soft tailoring inspired by or made in Naples, but not every guy looks good in that. Be honest with what looks the best on you, even if what you want to wear isn\u2019t it.\u201d Mitchell suggests taking advantage of Instagram or menswear forums to get opinions on whether certain choices, \u201clike jacket length, shoulder expression (soft? Spalla camicia? Roped? Padded? Extended? Narrow?), lapel width, gorge height, etc.\u201d are good fits for your body.Mitchell also recommends reading the style room, so to speak. \u201cYou know how every 4-6 years some fashion label decides to try and \u2018bring camo back\u2019? Well, guess what, I live in rural Middle Tennessee. If I wear camo, I\u2019m just another \u201cPerson of Walmart.\u201d On the other end of the spectrum, wearing a full-blown suit and tie might seem a little silly unless I\u2019m on a date with my wife or going to church.\u201d\u201cSo for me dressing the way I want means soft tailored jackets paired with denim (often white or off-white), an open-collared shirt, and suede loafers or ankle boots. The tailored jacket is flattering, so I look good; I feel cool because I like how I look and get satisfaction out of the details of the jacket; and I\u2019m expressing my personal style through my choices of fabrics, colors, aesthetic, silhouette, etc.\u201dWhile Mitchell acknowledges enthusiast forums are a useful resource, he\u2019s wary of rules and tropes that become gospel by virtue of being repeated. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting a little bit more into wristwatches lately, [eds. note; unsurprisingly, Mitchell has great taste in watches \u2014check out his Instagram] and seeing all the little bits of received wisdom/groupthink in the online watch world that have built up over the years has helped me gain perspective on the online men\u2019s style community, which has its own share of received wisdom/groupthink.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn that will help you look better if you know it,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cBut there comes a moment after you\u2019ve figured all that out when you realize that good taste evolves just as language does. That includes tailoring, and while there are many examples of people trying to do something clever and failing, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t remix things in your way and land on something unique that looks great, makes you feel cool, and expresses your personal style.\u201dFiled Under:Basics,Everyday Dressing,Menswear Musings,Mitchell in Nashville,Real People",

      "body": "The Hungerford Buildingin Rochester, New York is a sprawling, four-story industrial center that overlooks a train yard. A hundred years ago, it was the home of the J. Hungerford Smith Company, an American manufacturer for soda fountain flavoring syrups. They were known for their \u201ctrue fruit\u201d formulations, such as Cherry Chic, Golden Orangeade, and the licorice, aged vanilla flavor that goes into A&W\u2019s root beer. At one point, they were one of the largest employers in Rochester, but the company hasn\u2019t been based here in many decades. In 1963, they moved out of their longtime home and eventually relocated to Tennesse, after which they were acquired by Conagra. At the Rochester building that still bears their name, you\u2019ll no longer find whizzing, humming machines that produce flavoring syrups, but a community of artists, craftspeople, and small businesses.David Lane Designis one of those small businesses. Tucked away in one of these red-brick buildings is their modest, one-room workshop. This space is neatly organized with workbenches and heavy tables, which hold an array of leatherworking tools. There are pricking irons, mallets, edgers, awls, waxed threads, and needles; a wooden clamp for securing leather while it\u2019s being handsewn; a leather strop for sharpening blades. The most complicated tool here is sitting in the back of the workshop. It\u2019s a clicker press with a swing arm and a white sticker plastered on the side that shouts \u201cMIGHTY WONDER.\u201dDavid DeMarte, the company\u2019s founder and sole craftsperson, works here. He transforms leather hides from Italy, France, and the United States into beautifully crafted watch straps, handbags, belts, and wallets using a time-honored technique known as saddle stitching. This is the same technique thatleatherworkers at Hermes use to craft their fine leather accessories.In this tradition, a craftsperson first punches holes into the leather with a pricking iron before threading two needles through with a careful pace and repetition. One needle enters from the left and another from the right, with the craftsperson repeatedly stretching their arms like how a bird stretches its wings.The result is a tighter, more secure seam than what can be achieved with a machine-sewn lockstitch. Whereas a lockstitch can unravel if one part breaks, a saddle stitch has to be picked apart using a special tool.In an interview with local news station WHEC, David describes his leather goods as \u201cheirloom quality.\u201dI occasionally email David for his opinion when I\u2019m thinking about purchasing a watch. With over fifteen years of experience in making watch straps, he\u2019s seen a lot of quality timepieces. He\u2019s also been passionate about watches for even longer than he\u2019s been a craftsman (his first straps were sold atPaneristi, a Panerai enthusiast forum where he\u2019s been a member since 2007). Additionally, I admire his style and approach to clothing. Many men interested in style are obsessed with just one type of item \u2014 watches, shoes, jeans, fragrances, or tailored suits. These niche-within-a-niche subcultures are often very inward-looking, such that guys will debate the minutia related to mechanical movements, Goodyear welting, or handsewn buttonholes, but not how these items should relate to a broader wardrobe.David, on the other hand, is always thinking about the bigger picture. When purchasing a watch, he thinks about how the design fits into his lifestyle and wardrobe. Next to his Shetland tweeds and navy sport coats, he has more casual clothes, such as patched-up jeans, heavy cardigans, chambray shirts, and chore coats. When put together in outfits, all these items work together in concert \u2014 sleek loafers are worn with tailored trousers, work boots with jeans, and suede chukkas with smart-casual ensembles. Best of all, his choices suit him in terms of cut, personality, and lifestyle. He has clothes for the different sections of his life \u2014 tailoring for his work as a high school educator, workwear when he\u2019s crafting leather goods. It\u2019s what I would describe as a holistic wardrobe.There are two distinct sides to David\u2019s wardrobe, tailored and casual, although they\u2019re designed so that the clothes can be easily mixed. David started seriously getting into tailored clothing around the time when he launched his leather goods business. By his own characterization, he didn\u2019t have a lot of money back then, so he started shopping for ready-to-wear and made-to-measure. The clothes were a bit hit and miss until David started using bespoke tailors, which is when he began hitting his stride. \u201cI learned about silhouette and drape, the benefits of a high armhole, and why the details are much less important than fit,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just the fit but creating the best version of me in clothes.\u201dThese days, David relies on New York tailorsFranco ErcoleandFrank Shattuckfor his suits and sport coats, and thenCEGOfor his dress shirts. During the fall and winter months, he often reaches for his Shetland tweeds, particularly one made from a gun club cloth he bought from the tailoring enthusiast forumLondon Lounge. David wears them with dark jeans, heavy flannels, oxford cloth button-downs, denim shirts, suede chukkas, and shell cordovan loafers. In the warmer months, he swaps the tweeds out for inky blue hopsack and Fresco sport coats, which he pairs with grey tropical wool trousers, linen-cotton chambray shirts, striped button-ups, unlined suede loafers, and black tassel loafers. In the photos above, you can see him wear some of these items to his job as a high school art teacher, a subject he\u2019s been teaching for twenty years.Like most men, David prefers a slightly softer shoulder line, but his shoulder construction isn\u2019t so soft that it\u2019s mushy. A lot of modern tailoring is trim, short, and uber-soft, such that there\u2019s little to no padding in the shoulder line. With such little construction underneath, the jacket does little but recreate your natural body\u2019s shape. By contrast, David\u2019s coats have a silhouette of their own \u2014 a tiny bit of fullness in the chest, curved fronts, and sensible, middle-of-the-road proportions. \u201cFrank Shattuck is the only tailor I have found that shapes the bottom of the coat below the waist, which curves in past my stomach to create a leaner look from the profile,\u201d David says. \u201cIt\u2019s not much, but you can\u2019t unsee it once you notice it.\u201dThe casual side of his wardrobe is mainly made of trad items fromO\u2019Connell\u2019sand stylish workwear items from upscale labels such asRRL. \u201cIn leatherworking, I am constantly using glues, dies, and blades,\u201d he explains. \u201cWith workwear, if I cut something or stain my jeans or shirt, I can patch it, and it just looks natural, sometimes even better. They also last longer than dress clothes, which never look good with stains or holes.\u201d When David is heading to the workshop, he\u2019s often in jeans, flannels, or five-pocket cords, sometimes paired with anO\u2019Connell\u2019s ShetlandorRRL shawl collar cardiganfor warmth. On his Instagram, you can see how he creates simple, but stylish outfits by layeringchamois shirts over henleysandchunky Southwestern-style cardigans over flannels. His casual shoes include sneakers, work boots, and ropers.In the outfits above, you can see how he creates coherent outfits by pairing dressier suede shoes with grey tailored trousers and a brown wool-silk-linen sport coat (the touch of spring green in the shirt is a nice touch), while casual ensembles consist of heavy work shirts, thick outer layers, raw denim jeans, and rounder work boots. Notice how everything comes together to create a message. While David occasionally mixes dressy items with casual (e.g. jeans with a sport coat), the pieces are carefully chosen so the outfits are harmonious. If David wore a pair of dressier shoes with the suede chore coat outfit above, it would ruin the look.\u201cIt\u2019s important to me to feel comfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I feel like I\u2019m trying too hard or in a costume, I\u2019ll change clothes and pull the reins a bit. Not for the sake of others, but for myself, as I want to feel comfortable in what I\u2019m wearing. I\u2019ve tried to build my wardrobe with this in mind. I keep most of my tailoring tame in terms of color, and try to use casual, textured fabrics such as tweed. That way, I wear things interchangeably with jeans or flannel shirts. From there, I try adding layers and different accessories, such as hats or scarves. Layering is a great way to add some visual interest, but on a bigger frame like mine, it\u2019s important not to addtoomuch.\u201dDavid\u2019s Suggestions for Building a WardrobeIn the course of our conversion, I ask David here and there if he has suggestions for guys who are just starting to build a better wardrobe. He gave the following tips:Dressing for Larger Build:\u201cI look for clothes with a classic silhouette \u2014 nothing too long or short, wide or skinny. If you know someone who has a good eye for proportions, ask them for their opinion. I have a local seamstress who will tell me when something doesn\u2019t work, saving me time and money. It also sounds silly, but I\u2019ll take photos of myself in a new garment to see how it looks on me. When you\u2019re looking at yourself in the mirror, you do not always see the whole story. So I\u2019ll set up the timer on my cell phone camera and snap a few photos, including the front, back, and side views. I\u2019ll look for whether the garment is pulling anywhere and how the fabric drapes. If there\u2019s tension, especially around the waist, I\u2019ll usually pass \u2014 95% of the time in workwear and 100% of the time in tailoring.I also want to be comfortable in my clothes, so I like to see how clothes fit for real-life activities, not just standing in front of a mirror. I\u2019ll check to see if a garment is too short when I\u2019m reaching up, or if pants are too short for when I\u2019m bending down. It\u2019s not just about how clothes look on you, but how they make you feel throughout the day.For bigger guys building a wardrobe, I think the most common mistake is settling. There aren\u2019t many good ready-to-wear options for our build, so when you find something cool that\u2019s close to fitting well, it\u2019s easy to feel like you should buy it. But eventually, you\u2019ll find you\u2019re not comfortable in the item or don\u2019t look good in it, so you sell it for a loss. The other mistake is not taking advantage of your local tailor. Big guys often have to size up, but when they do, the sleeves or legs are too long. Find a local tailor who can take care of these things for you. Lastly, I look for a silhouette that\u2019s flattering and has some shape to it. For tailoring, I like a soft, natural shoulder with no roping, a slight pinch to the waist, and enough room for me to comfortably move around underneath. Trousers should be slightly tapered and have a single break to them. For workwear, I like my clothes to have even more room. I\u2019m OK if there\u2019s even less shape to the silhouette. I want to be able to layer.\u201dSuggestions for a Capsule Wardrobe:\u201cWhen you\u2019re starting, resist the temptation of sales. When you shop on sale, you often need to make a compromise, but the truth is that you don\u2019t need that many things to have a good, working wardrobe. For a capsule wardrobe, I would do:A grey or navy suitA brown tweed with three patch pocketsAn unlined mid-blue summer sport coat in a breathable fabricOne or two oxford cloth button-down shirts in light blueTwo to four casual shirts in chambray or denim. Get some with a pocket and some without, and get them in varying shades of blueA dress shirt with white and light blue stripesA white linen shirt with flapped chest pocketsTwo Shetland sweaters. I would start with navy and dark grey (or one in a color that matches your pet\u2019s hair, if you have one)A chunky shawl collar cardiganA pair of dark blue jeansA pair of mid- or light gray flannelsA pair of tropical wool trousers in light grayA pair of tan cordsA pair of olive green military-inspired fatiguesA pair of dark brown suede chukkas or loafersOuterwear based on your climate. My most used coat is a navy quilted Barbour.Some accessories: a navy knitted hat, a navy cashmere scarf, and a good brown leather beltOnce you have these bases covered, I think you should explore. For me, I would get a third sport coat in a patterned, mid-weight cloth. Again, stick to staple colors, such as navy or brown. I would also get an olive green overshirt or chore coat in cotton or wool, a hand-knit RRL cardigan (get something with an interesting pattern or color), a plaid flannel shirt in red or burnt orange, a pair of black or brown work boots, and a pair of simple white sneakers. A leather coat isn\u2019t a necessity, but it\u2019s a hell of a thing to have. Since I\u2019m bald, I would want a baseball cap in yellow or blue. And finally, I would get a thick pair of brown horn sunglasses and then a solid, time-only mechanical watch \u2014 nothing over 40mm.\u201dFinding a Watch for Your Wardrobe:\u201cWatches should fit with your wardrobe. I would steer away from the extremes, such as paper-thin, yellow gold Calatravas, or big, chunky, resin-cased watches with 87 functions and a flame thrower. If you buy something too precious, formal, or \u2018out there,\u2019 you\u2019ll never wear it. Stick with what you can use. If you travel and wear suits to work, get a solid GMT or Reverso. If you work from home, wear chunky shawl collar cardigans, and make pour-over coffee, get a chronograph so you can time your pours. If you work with your hands, wear jeans and leather jackets, get something such as a field watch, which will look better with scratches and dings. Above all, get a watch you will actually wear and use.If you have the money for one, I don\u2019t think you can do better than a vintage or modern Rolex Submariner for a one-watch collection. They go well with workwear or tailoring, and they look just as great on a suede or shell cordovan NATO, as they do on a bracelet. If you like that style but want something more affordable, you can get an excellent vintage Skin diver for about $300 and up, depending on the brand. They\u2019re a good size at about 35mm to 38mm, have a unique case shape, squared out lugs, and a rotating bezel. That watch on a simple black or dark brown strap in calfskin or goatskin will pair well with tailoring, while a suede strap or nylon NATO can be used with workwear.There are a ton of them on eBay, and they\u2019re not too expensive to service.When I\u2019m in workwear, I often wear a vintage Cyma on a canvas strap I made. They look great on leather two-piece straps, nylon NATO straps, mesh bracelets, and everything in between. If you\u2019re not into vintage, you can also get a new field watch. If you often wear suits, however, you should step up the formality in your timepiece. A simple, time-only watch in steel, set with a black or white dial and matte alligator strap, will look great with a tailored suit.\u201dTake It Slow:\u201cMy biggest piece of advice is to take your time. I\u2019ve built my wardrobe over fifteen years, and I only purchase one or two pieces of tailored clothing per year. New shoes get added every year or two; shirts come here and there. It takes a while to find what you like. When I first started, I loved the look of balmoral shoes \u2014lovedthem. I bought five pairs in different materials, soles, and designs. But even though I loved them, they didn\u2019t make any sense with what I actually wore. I\u2019ve since sold all of them at a considerable loss, except for one pair of balmorals in black. Don\u2019t keep things just became you like them. If they don\u2019t get worn or can\u2019t be tailored to fit, sell them and move on.As I mentioned earlier, you also want to find a good tailor. Ask them for advice: what are the risks of tapering trousers or letting out a seam? Establish a relationship with your tailor \u2014 bring them a small gift, tip them, or be kind and understanding about the jobs you bring in. Oh, and don\u2019t go in when you\u2019re in a hurry. Once my clothes are pinned, I will walk around, go back to the fitting room, and even snap a few photos. Like with shopping, this should be a considered process.\u201d(photos viaJaiden Tripi Photography,Julia Merrell, andDavid Lane Design)Filed Under:Accessories,David from Rochester,Davide Lane Design,Real People,Watch Straps,Watches",

The firm initially created durable attire for manual laborers from its distinctive duck canvas, and gradually became a trusted provider to Detroit's automobile factory workers, as well as blue-collar workers across America.In 1989, German fashion creators Edwin and Salomee Faeh negotiated a deal to launch a European subsidiary of the brand named Work in Progress, crafting polished, stylized adaptations ofCarhartt's offerings for the European skaters, and party-goers who were attracted to the brand's robust, reasonably priced attire.

The essence of the American streetwear brand is contained in a book he read as a child with his parents,My Utmost for His Highest, a religious writing by Oswald Chambers. Lorenzo often spoke about how these readings inspired him to create his brand.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowFear of God, defined by the designer himself as a luxury streetwear brand, is an expression of his lifestyle and aesthetic, far removed from the commercial machinations and seasonality of fashion presentations. Lorenzo's intentions are to convey a message beyond just the product, but without trying to indoctrinate nonbelievers.The style of the Fear of God garments is heavily influenced by what Jerry Lorenzo grew up with as a child; there are references to the 1980s by the guys from The Breakfast Club, to the 1990s with the looks of Kurt Cobain and Allen Iverson and baseball. This mix of references results in plaid flannel shirts with side zippers, oversized bomber jackets, baggy shorts with hems left raw, striped T-shirts, and the ultimate understated (or eternal to stay on brand) designs ofluxury smart-casual.Fabrics come from Japan and Italy and alternate with vintage pieces, creating timeless clothes andshoesthat are easy and comfortable to wear every day and whose luxury is recognized in their aesthetics, garments, and prices.

This shouldn\u2019t necessarily come as a surprise; current trends across the spectrum have been dominated bySupreme, theNew York skate brandwhose formula is largely built on the legacy of \u201890s street fashion.Beyond that particular connection, however, the \u201890s as an era is well-known for its wealth of fashion trends. As the last period before the digital world dominated culture, the legacy of the \u201890s is viewed through a rose-tinted lens of CD covers, magazine spreads, cable TV shows, and blockbuster films.Black music groups like Bones Thugs-n-Harmony and Boyz II Men took the aesthetic of \u201890s hip-hop and created a style that influenced virtually every major boy band of the decade, and Hollywood blockbusters likePoetic Justice,Boyz n the Hood,andJuiceplaced black American style on the big screen and created some of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history (as well as some solid acting performances from Janet Jackson, Ice Cube andTupac Shakur).Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowFor anyone who came of age in the era, just hearing the words \u201890s hip-hop fashion probably triggers a laundry list of reference points and essential pieces, but even then it can be difficult to describe them in words. As for younger generations who are buying contemporary pieces from labels likeOFF-WHITE,Palace, and Guess, it might be hard to understand the references without first-hand familiarity.So here\u2019s a brief rundown of the essential \u201890s hip-hop fashion wardrobe, and how each piece came to embody the style of the times in its own little way.Everything you need to know about 90s hip-hop fashion, from the iconic to the obscure.Timberland BootsOther / Tim Mosenfelder / ImageDirectTo this day, the humble suedeTimberlandboot in its classic tan colorway is known as a staple of New York-style, but its origins can also be traced to \u201890s hip-hop. Though intended for construction workers and the like, the word is the shoes gained traction among New York\u2019s drug dealers who needed strong, sturdy footwear to keep their feet warm and dry during long hours out in the streets.Biggie, Tupac, Nas,Aaliyah\u2013 virtually every hip-hop and R&B artist you can think of \u2013 all woreTimberland bootsand still do today.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowSold OutTimberland6 Inch Premium Boot Yellow$230.00Sold OutSold OutTimberland x Nina ChanelFuture73 6-Inch Boot Claypot$310.00Sold OutDungareesHighsnobiety / Eva Al DesnudoOf all the weird and wonderful styles that the \u201890s produced, the popularity of denim dungarees, however welcome, is probably hardest to place. Fitted or baggy, strapped up or with one undone, styled with T-shirts, hoodies, button-ups or nothing at all, the unexpected trend got a cultural cosign from the likes of TLC, The Fugees, Will Smith and Tupac, and became a staple of the era.If you wanted proof that we\u2019re going through a \u201890s revival right now, consider that Supreme released a pair of dungarees several seasons back, and have released at least one pair consistently every season since.

Throughout the film, Brown and several of his members can be seen wearingKangol capswith the brand\u2019s logo proudly displayed.A few years later, Quentin Tarantino would follow up his hit filmPulp FictionwithJackie Brown, an homage to \u201870s blaxploitation cinema starring Samuel L.

Seeing a new colorway drop and resell for hundreds of dollars minutes later is just part of the culture. But back in the \u201890s, the idea of sneakers as anything more than something for sport was an alien concept.When basketball player Michael Jordan partnered up with young sportswear brand Nike on a signatureAir Jordansneaker in 1984, the shoe quickly erupted into a national phenomenon. A few years later, Nike spun the series off into its ownAir Jordan line, creating possibly the first chapter in sneakerhead culture.

Exploring the fashions of grime, here's a brief history topped with 5 essential grime pieces. Get to know.Anyone seeking a look that's 100% grime need checkDizzee Rascalon the cover of his breakout debut,Boy In Da Corner. There he is, just sitting there \u2013 all-black tracksuit, black Nikes, black gloves, hood up. The complete package. And it\u2019s not just his clothes, either; his pose, his expression and his gaze all read total grime. This much-celebrated album would go on to collect the Mercury Music Prize in 2003 \u2013 a prize not just for Dizzee, but the whole grime scene he\u2019d helped nurture and grow \u2013 and there he is, hunched against a wall, in nothing but a shop-bought Nike two-piece. He\u2019s not showing off a Rolex, a Maserati, a trophy woman, or his six-pack. It's just him; that's what makes this total grime.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowWhereas US hip-hop spent the early part of the Twenty-First Century dedicated to the vulgar excess of sports cars, video girls, bejewelled pimp cups, and perpetual one-upmanship, grime was about eschewing luxury for a visual aesthetic that, like grime itself, was about the authentic day-to-day experience of inner-city London. That\u2019s why Dizzee isn\u2019t announcing himself as some huge star born and ready to make his money. He\u2019s just sitting there, waiting.And, when you pop his CD in the deck, you won\u2019t hear him name check the designer labels he's shopping or the chains he's wearing. The opening track sets it down, with the line, \u201cbenefit claims and checks in false names/no sign of positive change.\u201d Early grime was never about urban excess, but about being honest about the daily struggle. As such, its sense of style was born from a feeling of disenfranchisement from the cultures that came before.Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.Enable All MediaManage consentPrivacy policyWant to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowYouth culture can often be best understood as a reaction to its direct precedents. Grime is, in many ways, a direct rejection of UK garage, whose own emphasis on sex and ecstatic indulgence were an antidote to the dearth of fashion that came via the big rave and drum and bass scenes. The sharp dress sense in UK garage clubs was a 180-degree departure from the spirit of pluralism and comfort espoused by the rave movement, whose uniform was effortless and unmistakably sloppy.With rave, the sense of empathy afforded by massive crowds dancing all night on ecstasy made looking better than the person next to you seem ostentatious and a million miles away from the free-loving energy the movement was founded on. And, since everyone was just there to dance, punters simply showed up in comfortable trainers and baggy trousers that were suitable for the marathon dancefloor session. If said dancefloor happened to be in the middle of a muddy rural field, you certainly weren't about to wear your best shirt and shoes.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.Enable All MediaManage consentPrivacy policyIn response, UK garage turned around the baggy look that dominated both the \"Second Summer of Love\" in \u201988-\u201989 and, arguably, most of the early jungle and drum & bass years. Clubbers didn\u2019t listen to garage among thousands of ravers in fields off the motorway, or in dingy warehouses on the outskirts of the city. Though nightclubs had always been a part of UK nightlife, by the time garage was number one, massive pop-up raves were a thing of the past and going out was done exclusively in clubs where the punter was encouraged to dress up for the occasion.Much like US hip-hop, going out to a garage night was a celebration of excess. It was commonplace to see a man dancing on the floor with a magnum of champagne in hand, his thumb sealed over the mouth of the bottle. A key facet of garage culture was blowing all your money in one night \u2013 whether on girls, cocaine or champagne \u2013 and clothes were a big part of this consumerist rush. People went out to look their best, to impress and, since garage re-introduced both sexiness and an off-kilter swing to London\u2019s dancefloors following the macho rush of drum & bass, nights out were about impressing those of the opposite sex by any and every means possible.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.Enable All MediaManage consentPrivacy policyThis high-rolling look was also enforced at the nightclub door. Many UK garage clubs in the late \u201990s banned items of streetwear like trainers, jeans, and baseball caps. These forbidden items would go on to become the chief pieces of grime fashion. Grime was born out of a frustration with garage\u2019s ritzy elitism, but its style wasn\u2019t just a rebellion against what came before in order to make room for something new. It was an aesthetic adopted because it more truly reflected its wearers' identities. AsSkeptaspat on grime anthemThat's Not Me, \u201cI used to wear Gucci, put it all in the bin cause that\u2019s not me.\u201d And so it was: Versace out,Nikein. Silk shirts out, tracksuits in.\u201cThe street culture to London, grime\u2019s the soundtrack to that,\u201d once said seminal grime DJ Logan Sama. \u201cIt runs in parallel: the dress code, the music, they\u2019re all reflection of that.\u201d So, grime fashion is the look of the everyman on the street, but has to be kept fresh and clean. Though it\u2019s about sometimes wearing trackies and trainers, your tracksuit better be crisp and your trainers (sneakers) better not be scuffed. And though grime isn\u2019t about labels worthy of Vanity Fair, grime MCs still engage in a fair bit of brand worship of their own.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowThe hottest grime threads came from Avirex, Akademiks or, of course, Nike. The Nike Air Max holds one of the true monopolies on the grime wardrobe. Though you could wear any number of different tracksuits, there was really only one brand for sneakers. Watch one of the early editions ofLord of the Mics \u2013a straight-to-DVD release of grime MCs battling and freestyling against each other \u2013 and they\u2019re all wearing Air Max. You could just about get away with wearing the Air Force 1, too, but the Air Max was practically a requirement for any MC. The shoes were often called the \"110,\" in reference to their \u00a3110 price tag.TheAvirexleather jacket \u2013 an expensive holdover from the garage days \u2013 meanwhile, was a dangerous piece. Men got jumped on the street just for their Avirex jackets, so wearing one became a symbol of pride and audacity. \"Jump me,\" it dared, \"just try it.\" In summer, the jacket would come off, but the cap would stay on, and the only cap to wear was theNew Erafitted 59Fifty, pulled down to your brows so people could see you still had the gold sticker on i.e. it was brand new.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowAs such, though dressing grime was about eschewing luxury for realness, you still had to look like you just came fresh from the shop. It's here that grime fashion begins to walk a fine line between expense and authenticity. On the one one had, you have to rep a pristine collection of the relatively expensive Air Max \u2013 but we\u2019re still just talking Nike here, not crocodile Gucci loafers. Ultimately, dressing grime is about keeping real to yourself, while still looking good. You could say dressing grime is about looking like the best version of yourself, even if that does mean laying out a couple dozen more for your shoes.These days, grime is the everyman look for everyone. Designers likeNasir Mazharhave even been bringing grime to the runway (Skepta walked in his Spring/Summer \u201815 grime-influenced menswear collection) and, though many other designers have made twenty-first century athletic wear into high fashion, this certainly wasn\u2019t always the case. At one time, the world thought that dressing grime meant you were trouble and it kept you out of the clubs. These days, the doors are wide open.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowFurther your grime education with our previous featuresA Beginner's Guide to Grimeand5 Things You Need To Know About Grime.Written by Taylor Hodges for Highsnobiety.comPhotographyGareth Cattermole/Getty Images (Lead)grimeContributor",

What was once banned at clubs is the new club uniform. \u201cLuxury sneakers\u201d are Exhibit A: from contradiction to conqueror, the past decade has led to a world where Dior x Nike Air Jordan 1s are just exceptional, and not the exception.While Kanye\u2019s 2009 LV tie-up felt like the start of things to come, it was the past 10 years that truly merged the worlds of luxury and streetwear. Join us as we look back on the moments that defined this new vision of luxury.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowSneaker Brands Codify the Lux CollabHighsnobiety / Asia TypekThe first luxury sneaker collabs came in the late '90s, when shoes like the Nike x Junya Watanabe Zoom Haven introduced the world to deliberately un-sporting sportswear. But these initial collections were acommercial, limited, and few and far between. Between 2000\u2019s Reebok x Chanel Instapump Fury (just a few pairs were made for the runway show) and2017\u2019s global Vetements release on the same shoe, sneaker brands codified the luxury collab.The past decade saw the lion\u2019s share of the action. In 2010, Nike and UNDERCOVER\u2019s Jun Takahashi debutedGyakusou. In 2013,the first sneak shots of Raf x adidasappeared online.

The past 10 years have seen every major luxury brand add sneakers (the staple shoe of streetwear, the bane of \u201cproper\u201d dressing) to their assortment. Saint Laurent and Gucci steal the headlines. To recognize the impact of this, ask yourself about the others.Couture houses? Check. Givenchy sneakers. Valentino sneakers.

Oliver, a double-dropout from both NYU and New York\u2019s Fashion Institute of Technology, made clothing under the brand for his friends in the city\u2019s club scene. As a concept, Hood by Air (aka \u201cHBA\u201d) was meant to be elevated streetwear of the type that Oliver deemed \u201cpowerwear.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about exuding power and fluidity,\u201d the designer toldVogue in 2013. \u201cI\u2019m not really interested in unisex, per se.

And the hits just kept coming.Over just a few seasons, Hedi Slimane would make the house Yves built into one of the world\u2019s biggest brands.

Perhaps \u2013 it\u2019s all just clothes.Formed in 2014 by a then-unknown Demna Gvasalia, the French fashion collective known as Vetements (\u201cclothing,\u201den fran\u00e7ais) was fashion\u2019s first galaxy brain since Margiela. Deconstructed garments and a slew of collabs hit Paris runways. Pure mirth radiated. And somewhere in the middle, an oversized cotton hoodie with the German word for \u201cPOLICE\u201dgot a $900 price tag.Vetements was a half-decade sea change \u2013 a midpoint in the melding of luxury and streetwear.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowGvasalia would go on to lead Balenciaga\u2019s revival, designing iconic garments like the Triple-S sneaker and Campaign bomber. Vetements would go on to collab with18 brands during one runway show.\u201cJust clothes\u201d? In a sense, sure. But from the galaxy-brain view, there was nothing insignificant about it.New Guards Group Forms the Kering of DaringHighsnobiety / Eva Al DesnudoIn 2015, Claudio Antonioli, Davide De Giglio, and Marcelo Burlon formed New Guards Group, a holding company for luxury fashion brands. Just like Kering (Gucci, Balenciaga, Saint Laurent) and LVMH (everything else), New Guards formed so its designer brands could share resources.Unlike Kering and LVMH, however, New Guards was all about streetwear.With a stable of brands including OFF-WHITE\u2122, Heron Preston, Palm Angels, and Burlon\u2019s eponymous label, New Guards brought the codes of the luxury business to edgy, high-end street labels. Sure, some of those labels may have been showing Barney\u2019s-bound ready-to-wear collections during international fashion weeks, but their source code was streetwear in a way that no LVMH or Kering brands could ever claim.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowEarlier this year, luxury fashion e-trailer Farfetch bought New Guards Group for $675 million.

Just add five hours; swap Simons for Burberry. Sneakers still reigned.While major brands had used runways to launch new shoe collabs, the year of \u201cOFF CAMPUS\u201d flipped the script. Streetwear was no longer a component of high fashion. It was the biggest story of fashion week.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowBrands like Balenciaga, Gucci, and Saint Laurent may have recast streetwear tropes for the world of luxury. But when it came to a matchup between the old ways and the new, streetwear proper could win.Moncler Genius Makes Streetwear Collabs a CanvasMonclerBy 2018, the balance between streetwear and luxury had fully tilted. Forget dress codes. Forget the old ways. Starting with Riccardo \u2013 and catalyzed by Vetements \u2013 it was now all just clothing.But where some saw homogeny, others saw a canvas.Moncler\u2019s Genius Initiative saw the heritage Italian ski brand grant its luxurious catalog to a slew of famous names across fashion and streetwear.

Some brought a streetwear touch to jackets designed for French Alp apr\u00e8s. Green took his design to theextreme. While Vetements used the lux-streetwear collab to question, Moncler used it to exclaim.Now in its third season, the Moncler Genius initiative saw the confluence of luxury and streetwear elevated into a place of expression. Forget luxe vs. street. With Genius, it was just about fashion.KITH x Versace Takes Lux Streetwear to PrimetimeKITHAfter Genius, the floodgates were open. 2019's KITH x Versace collection was more than a clothing collab: it was a downtown Manhattan takeover. Billboards and posters popped up around SoHo. Local grocerDean & DeLucasported Versace print shopping bags. Two famous neighborhood restaurants, Sadelle's and Carbone,even featured special KITH Medusa menus.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowAnd then, of course, there were the $1,000 hoodies.Capped off by a KITH edition of the house's street-inspired Chain Reaction sneaker,the collectionticked off a list of luxury-streetwear tropes. Collab? Check. Lux staples? Check. Eye-popping price tag? For those same sneakers,one whole check. KITH expanded the footprint, and in doing so paved the streets with luxury streetwear.The Godfathers of Streetwear Go LuxHighsnobiety / Asia TypekBut that's not where the story ends. What, you really thought we'd forget these?KITH x Versace and Moncler x Everyone brought luxury streetwear to new highs. But they did it by standing on the shoulders of a giant. In 2017 \u2013 yes, roll back a bit \u2013 Supreme and Louis Vuitton announced a surprise collaboration during Paris Fashion Week.Supreme x Louis Vuittonwas a watershed moment \u2013 not just for high-low collabs, but for fashion as a whole. At the world's most famous Fashion Week, here was streetwear as luxury. Lux streetwear was nothing new, but in the past, it had come by way ofmaisonsaping Mercer Street. Now, the world's most famous streetwear brand had lent its name (and its credibility) to the brand at the head of the world's largest luxury group.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowSupreme x LV meant legitimacy. On a darker note, it also meant that a once-contradictory segment \u2013 once the place of \"powerwear\" and downtown edge \u2013 had gone mainstream. Hype blogs and fashion books covered the collection. Then again, so did theFinancial Times. The dam had burst; nothing was sacrosanct. Even the storied Chanel lowered its guard, teaming up with Pharrell for its first-ever collaboration.So when Kim Jones (the head of menswear at Louis Vuitton who initiated Supreme x LV) again brought a godfather of streetwear to a luxury collab just this month, it was both surprising and no surprise at all. Sure, theDior x Shawn Stussy showwas a massive announcement.

And with a new decade right around the corner, it will be.Gucci x Dapper DanGucciFinally, an epilogue.Daniel \"Dapper Dan\" Day is a Harlem-born tailor who rose to prominence in the '70s and '80s for his high-end recuts of luxury bags. \"Dap,\" as he's known, cut bags from brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton down to their deadstock fabric, then restitched it into seriously ill ready-to-wear for the style-minded in Harlem.His garmentsare an exercise in vision and invention. Decades before Imran Potato \u2013 when the brands whose bags he used had little interest in dressing Dan's black, urban customer base \u2013 Dapper Dan of Harlem quite literally broke it down to recast luxury for the street.Dan gear made it from North Manhattan to the closets of Mike Tyson, LL Cool J, Salt-N-Pepa, and many more. With the media attention his celeb clients were getting, those same disinterested brands became very interested indeed.Cease-and-desist letters began arriving at Dan's Harlem tailor shop. Fendi even pursued a lawsuit in 1988.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowFour years after Fendi v. Dap, Dan was forced to close up shop. Both ahead of his time and the victim of a less-than-welcoming luxury scene, the story of Dapper Dan could have ended there.But it didn't. In 2017, after a Gucci collection by designer Alessandro Michele bit the look of vintage Dan garments, a wave of internet blowback resulted inthe announcement of an official Gucci x Dapper Dan collab line. The partnership continues to this day.The same year that Supreme x Louis Vuitton brought the merger of luxury and streetwear to the mainstream, a scar from their separated past got the healing it seemed due. While the story of luxury streetwear is far from over, one of its earliest chapters now has a happy ending. Happy end of the decade, indeed.luxurylvmhSaint LaurentAlex RakestrawContributor",

      "body": "Luxury Brands Are Finally Learning How to Speak Streetwear Their Own WayWritten byChristopher Morency6 years agoinStyleHighsnobiety / Eva Al DesnudoWant to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowIt\u2019s been five weeks sincemen\u2019s fashion month kicked off in Londonand with the exception of Burberry, Gucci and Balenciaga \u2014 each have opted for co-ed shows presented during the upcoming women\u2019s fashion month \u2014 another men\u2019s season has drawn to a close.The most evident shift could be observed in the transition from dominant streetwear silhouettes to a new sense of tailoring as seen atLouis Vuitton,Dior HommeandPrada. After all, the same young men who in recent seasons have been parading down the runways in sneakers, technical outerwear and oversized everything are growing up. And so it wasn\u2019t surprising that a number of fashion publications were quick to shout that streetwear is pass\u00e9, over, done. But it\u2019s not. Streetwear as luxury brands have made it out to be is evolving, and that\u2019s a good thing for everyone.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowEver since the early days of subversive subcultural movements in the 1970s, young surfers and skaters have gravitated towards garments expressing individuality and comfort, while also serving as sartorial emblems that signify being part of a specific tribe, often an international community of like-minded youngsters with a lifestyle encompassing similar tastes in fashion, music and art, and political beliefs.Highsnobiety / Eva Al DesnudoWearing St\u00fcssy T-shirts and later FUBU sweatshirts weren\u2019t just status symbols, they were physical tokens of belonging. These brands never made just clothing. They made clothing with meaning.Still, major luxury houses remained dismissive of the growing cultural power of street culture, deeming it brand diluting. It took a number of forward-thinking designers to cross-pollinate the two once thought of as opposites by sending their luxury versions of banal streetwear items down the Paris runways \u2014 thinkRiccardo Tisci\u2019s Fall/Winter 2011 \"Rottweiler\" collection for Givenchy,Balenciaga\u2019s \"Join a Weird Trip\" sweatshirtsdesigned by Nicholas Ghesqui\u00e8re for Fall/Winter 2012 andC\u00e9line\u2019s beige rendition of the Air Force 1sfor Fall/Winter 2014 under the helm of Phoebe Philo.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowBy 2015, every luxury house, big or small, had created their indistinguishable take on the white, minimal sneaker inspired by adidas\u2019 Stan Smith and Superstar models. It was as much of a safe entrance into this new phenomenon called \u201cathleisure\u201d and its closely-knit ties to streetwear, as it was a response to the casualization of the way people were starting to dress. Nothing innovative there.January 2017 was a turning point when Louis Vuitton\u2019s artistic director Kim Jones launched afull-ranged collaboration with Supremefor the house's Fall/Winter 2017 season. That same month, Demna Gvasalia debuted Balenciaga\u2019s chunky Triple S sneaker \u2014 designed by footwear legend David Tourniaire-Beauciel, and inspired by retro Nike and New balance models \u2014 prompting instant consumer hysteria.Highsnobiety / Asia TypekFor the first time, it was luxury, not streetwear, dictating the consumption behavior of young shoppers when it came to sneakers. Streetwear, sportswear and other luxury brands followed suit with a thousand and one versions of the \"dad\" sneaker and by the time Virgil Abloh debuted his first collection as artistic director of Louis Vuitton and Kim Jones at Dior Homme in June 2018, that sameluxury influence on youth culture had transcended beyond sneakers alone.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowIt isn\u2019t hard to understand why premium brands want to court younger audiences. By 2025, 45 percent of the luxury market is set to be made up of Gen Z and Millennials, while these generations combined resulted in 85 percent of all luxury growth in 2017.In part,the new luxury consumeris starting to respond to luxury\u2019s efforts towards streetwear. Mainly because of luxury\u2019s new guard, including Virgil Abloh, Kim Jones and their more emerging peers Matthew Williams, Samuel Ross, Heron Preston and Jerry Lorenzo, who clearly understand that streetwear is about more than simply appropriating literal street style cues like graphic hoodies, oversized outerwear and sporty sneakers. Instead, the direction they\u2019re taking us into isn\u2019t streetwear as we know it.Highsnobiety / Eva Al DesnudoAs Virgil Abloh worded it in the show notes for his latestMichael Jackson-inspired Fall/Winter 2019 collection: \u201c[Streetwear\u2019s] sportswear properties are undergoing a critical transformation into luxury.\u201dWant to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowIndeed, streetwear, as it was presented in the past Fall/Winter 2019 men\u2019s season, is a first glimpse around how luxury brands will cater to young consumers in terms of design in the near future. Colorful, relaxed tailoring \u2014 not in the Saville Row way \u2014 paired with formal shoe-sneaker hybrids and a fresh take on leather goods made relevant to a younger generation through innovative hardware and prints is exactly what will get the new luxury consumer excited, especially when done by designers close to the culture.Designers without direct ties to street culture equally succeeded this season, by using fabrics, creating silhouettes and authentically partnering with aspirational brands and figures with roots in youth culture likeFendi x Porter,Dior Homme x Matthew WilliamsandValentino x UNDERCOVER.Highsnobiety / Eva Al DesnudoWant to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowThe new way of working was reflected by Valentino\u2019s creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli afterhis latest show in Paris. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that streetwear is over, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he told Highsnobiety. \u201cIt\u2019s about rethinking the values of sartorialism, but with a more streetwear approach. So less effort and more relaxed. That\u2019s the only way for me.\u201dBut while luxury brands are finally learning how to speak the language of streetwear their own way, the majority still have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to the main component that makes kids around the world line up for hours each week to buy the newest drop and the hours spent on forums and Facebook groups.For younger generations luxury no longer means exclusivity or high price-points. Instead, having access, being value-driven and buying into a tribe is what makes them tick. Without those elements, hyped clothing without any cultural credibility won\u2019t be enough to buoy young shoppers going forward. As mentioned inHighsnobiety\u2019s first white paper, 85 percent of those interviewed believe that what their clothes represent is just as important as its quality or design.Want to stay in the loop?We've got you coveredDownload the Highsnobiety App nowHighsnobiety / Eva Al DesnudoLuxury brands need to learn how to speak through this new luxury audience, not to them. Streetwear as we knew it in past seasons isn\u2019t necessarily streetwear anymore, yet counterculture, and its interconnected sense of dressing, will be around forever in whatever form that may take, be it hoodies today or tailoring tomorrow.And until luxury brands crack that code, step down from their ivory tower and let in the people they\u2019re designing for, they\u2019ll always be one step behind where youth culture is truly playing out.For a deep-dive of how streetwear infiltrated, then defined the luxury market download our full whitepaperhere.virgil ablohHeron PrestonvalentinoChristopher MorencyEditorial Director",

Purchasing via our links may earnValet.a portion of the sale, which helps fund our editorial mission.Once upon a time,experts declared fashion trends, though perhaps cultural trends at large, would be back en vogue every 20 years. Nowadays, the cycle tends to be shorter. Some, like the resurgence of both country music and the Western aesthetic, never really faded in the first place. They were simply reduced from a raging boil to a mere simmer, destined to be brought back to temperature later on.And in 2024, the trend is boiling over. Last year saw the ascent of the country-indie and country-pop genres, plus their respective superstars, from Zach Bryan to Morgan Wallen. And though country music has far from taken over globally, the stateside Spotify 2023 year-end rankings placed Wallen first in both the most-streamed song and most-streamed album categories, edging out one-time country star Taylor Swift (she was still the most-streamed artist, to be fair).Beyonc\u00e9 has a country album on standby, too, and recentlytopped the charts with her first-ever country singles, \u201c16 Carriages\u201d and \u201cTexas Hold 'Em,\u201d which apply a country twang to the singer's typical tone. This said, the trend is far from simply sonic, and we're sure to see everyone from Austin Butler to Pharrell wearing Western attire.In fact, it's already begun, albeit in a bandwagon sort of way. Pharrell's latest Louis Vuitton collection was a \u201cCowboy-Western Epic,\u201d asGQput it\u2014a parade of models wearing cowboy hats, cropped jackets, flared pants, heeled boots, oversized belt buckles and bolo ties. It was something of a departure for the French-born fashion house, and the true-blue dressers of America would surely call it cosplay. But that's okay. Quite frankly, it is. As theNew York Times'Jon Caramanica points out, country is moving on from its pomp and circumstance, namely its costumes of belonging, to more rural digs, a sign that being country requires \u201cbeing country IRL,\u201d as he puts it. And while pop music, he points out, feels stuck in place, country music is moving forward\u2014clear evidence that this trend, no matter how hot it is, is still only toeing the precipice, peering up at its potential.AdvertisementSo, how do you dress cowboy-ish in an authentic way when everyone will surely try it over the next year? You stick to the foundational elements and avoid anything that feels like costuming. That ornate, pearl snap shirt? Probably not your best bet, especially if you typically wear sweats and sneakers. But a denim shirt with said snap buttons and yoke stitching? Much easier to incorporate into your regular rotation.I don't say this to dissuade anyone from buying something they truly love, but I speak from experience; I've bought plenty of things I liked on the hanger\u2014and hated on me. Plus, though I am by no means an expert on ranching, raising or training horses, maintaining a stable, or, hell, even riding a horse, I have studied, and long written about, the various eras of American menswear\u2014the \u201ccowboy\u201d ones included.For those wading into Western wear, in its simplest form, the country aesthetic is, well, simple. It calls on the classics and steers clear of overt fashion statements\u2014even if cowboy boots and cowboy hats feel quite statement-making in their own rights (and the foundation for many American fashion brands). From faded jeans and dusty boots to loopwheel T-shirts and broken-in belts, when put together correctly, the items that will look right at home on you.The Foundations ofa Western WardrobeWakayama loopwheel tee,$95 byStandard and StrangeClassic CottonT-ShirtYou want one that's soft yet hard-wearing.

That means you need to wear a good hat and be a man of your word. My aforementioned rule of avoiding costuming is critical when choosing your hat, though, because if you aren't going full country, you shouldn't wear a cowboy hat. Doing so in stretch denim or performance-fabric chinos will make you run the risk of looking like a bride on a bachelorette trip to Nashville.Corral 4X felt hat, $169.99 byStetsonCorral 4X felt hat, $169.99 byStetsonAdvertisementGregory boot,$275 byTecovas x Thomas RhettSerious BootsThere are countless variants, cut from leathers ranging from exotic to standard-fare, and numerous toe and heel types to choose from.

      "body": "A guide to the must-haves of men's summer style.10 October,2025ByAndrew Snavely/Photos ByAndrew SnavelyThis post may contain affiliate links, read about oureditorial promiseEvery guy has been there. He takes an interest in dressing better, joyously begins wearing cotton oxfords and selvedge denim. He learns the rakishness of layering with sweaters and outerwear. Then something unforeseen and terrible happens. Summer comes.Dressing well in the heat can feel so intimidating it seems impossible. As the rising mercury steals away our layers and textures and multitude of fabrics our advances in personal style come to a grinding halt. How can you dress well when first and foremost you have to dress to stay comfortable? How can you build multiple outfits if the only items you can wear are shirts, shorts, and shoes?The secret, as with most of men's style, is in the details. The following 15men's summer fashionitems can be mixed and matched in endless combinations ensuring your sartorial skill doesn't take a 4 month summer at the beach.1. The Polo That FitsYou\u2019re no stranger to the polo shirt, also known as a golf shirt or tennis shirt. Your mom had been dressing you in these for as long as you\u2019ve been fit to go out in public. You\u2019ve spent your life seeing middle-aged guys wear these tucked into dress pants. And you\u2019ve probably eschewed them as you\u2019ve started caring about your personal style, assuming they\u2019re for prep school kids and old guys on the golf course.And, if you\u2019re basing that on what you\u2019ve seen other guys doing, you\u2019d be right.But the reality is the polo shirt can be one of the sharpest and most versatile shirts in your wardrobe if you focus on getting the fit right.The polo actually has a fascinating history. In the early days of tennis, players (unfortunately) had to wear a full on regalia while on the court. Long sleeved button up shirts, ties, and flannel trousers(!?). As with all great change, it took a trailblazer to finally bring some sense to tennis attire. Ren\u00e9 Lacoste, seven-time Grand Slam champion, got fed up with how impractical and uncomfortable the uniform was and designed a short sleeve, knit pique cotton shirt with a collar and placket, and a \u201ctennis tail\u201d \u2013 a shirttail that was longer in the back to keep it from untucking. Lacoste first debuted his shirt at the 1926 US Open, and in 1927 began sewing a crocodile patch on the left chest after journalists began referring to him as \u201cThe Crocodile.\u201d After retiring in 1933, Lacoste went full-press into clothing merchandising.By the time Ralph Lauren showcased his polo shirt as a central figure in his new \u201cPolo\u201d line in 1972, the shirt became standard casual menswear.The secret, though, to not looking like an old man is to focus on the fit details. I\u2019m not prescribing a \u201ctight\u201d shirt, a proper fitting polo based on the guidelines below will have any gentleman, regardless of weight or shape looking sharp.A common mistake young guys make is trying to size down to achieve proper proportions which can lead to a shirt with some of the details right but is overall too small. Look for a different brand, fit, or consider cheapalterations by a tailor. I also personally avoid tucking in my polos in all but the strictest business casual environments, in which case I would opt for a tucked in button up instead.2. The Not Pique PoloBanana Republic, $119.99(similar)When an outfit is limited to only a shirt, belt, shorts, watch, and shoes, it\u2019s easy to get caught in an uninteresting, boring loop that makes you feel like you\u2019re a different Big Box sales associate, depending on the color of the day. To counteract the negative ill-fitting look imparted on us by two decades of corporate uniforms we have to hammer in hard on the details.The soft, luxurious cotton-silk blend polo shown here from H&M is a subtle aesthetic alternative to your run-of-the-mill pique polo. First, the smoother cotton versus the texture of a pique polo can have a surprising dual effect. If pairing with casual shorts and tennis shoes the smooth cotton can play almost like a t-shirt, tapping into the overall casualness.However, paired with slim, dressier shorts and penny loafers, a smooth cotton shirt now enhances the dressiness in a way a pique polo can\u2019t. A knit like this can also bedressed up for a great looking summer business casual, stay tuned for the Getup!3. The Fitted Flat Front Short in Multiple ColorsAmazon, $21If you\u2019re only going to buy one item on this list, it\u2019s the fitted flat front short. So many guys are still stuck wearing baggy, long cargo shorts from the likes of American Eagle and it\u2019s the single biggest thing holding them back with their smart summer style.I included the baggy cargo short on my list of11 Out of Style Trends You Should Phase Out of Your Wardrobesevenyears ago, and they were already YEARS out of style at that point. Yet, I still receive comments on that article from guys who refuse to let go of this 90\u2019s style staple. Look, I get it \u2013 if you carry a ton of crap with you and you need the cargo space, have at it, function over form. But if you\u2019re actively trying to dress well for summer events, they\u2019ve got to go.Shorts have become slimmer and higher for well over two decades. And while there are plenty that are too high and too tight as you start approaching the fashion end of the style spectrum, there is a great middle ground that will give you afitted silhouettewithout compromising comfort or showing too much leg. Don\u2019t be afraid of seeing an inch to two of leg above your knee cap: It creates a more put-together, intentional look. When done correctly, it won\u2019t look too tight or too short.Shorts come in different inseams these days, take a few pairs in the 7-9 inch region to the fitting room and see what works with your body. If you\u2019ve got monster quads, many slimmer models may not fit you; that doesn\u2019t mean you default to baggy shorts that don\u2019t fit, it means you find a different brand, or consider having them slimmed by a tailor. The cost of that, especially when buying affordable shorts in the $15-$30 range would be negligible \u2013 another $10-$15 at most. But what is the result? Crazy-good fitting shorts that you\u2019ll be able to wear for multiple seasons.Once you find some that fit, go hog wild and buy them in multiple colors. Again, with a limited number of itemsin our getups, any difference in detail, be it color or pattern, will create a drastically different look paired with the same shirt and shoes. Both Amazon'sAmazon EssentialsandJ.Crew Factoryoffer shorts inseams from 5 inches to 10 inches.4. Some Kind of LoaferJay Butler, $229/Minnetonka, $98/Florsheim, $140/Sperry, $99Can\u2019t wear boots because you\u2019re wearing shorts. Can\u2019t wear sneakers because wherever you\u2019re going needs to be a smidge dressier than that. What\u2019s a guy to do?The answer comes in several flavors. Whether it\u2019s a traditional penny loafer, preppy boat shoes, driving moc, or dress loafer, a slip-on leather shoe is an absolute summer essential.The loafer rose to sartorial prominence during the nation\u2019s obsession with New England Prep style in the 1960\u2019s. Once the domain of old men, or d-bags, or old men d-bags, the loafer has been within the everyman\u2019s style for over 30 years, so don\u2019t be afraid of them. No one is going to call you Mr. Harvard if you wear them, they\u2019re going to call you that annoying guy who is always so well-dressed.Wear it casually with a t-shirt or dress it up with slim fit chinos (#12) and a button up shirt. They\u2019re perfectly acceptable footwear in most summerbusiness casualsettings, and definitely my go-to for any summer date or jaunt. Once you\u2019ve trekked around in them for a week or two they mold to your feet and become beyond buttery comfortable. Make sure you always wear them sockless. In this domain, they\u2019re being worn the same way as sandals, and I know you know that you should never wear socks with sandals.5. The Linen ShirtQuince, $29.90So much of summer style has only two goals: Be comfortable, don\u2019t be uncomfortable. When the heat and humidity come in like a tidal wave, you have to start thinking strategically about not only what you\u2019ll choose to wear but what it\u2019s made out of. Linen is one of the best warm weather fabrics because it\u2019s thin and breathes very well. On humid days, ditch the thick cotton and incorporate a linen shirt, pants, or if you\u2019re near sand or water: both.The thing is, linen wrinkles A LOT, like\u2026 just from putting it on. Don\u2019t get frustrated \u2013 it\u2019s part of the package. You only need tosteam itwhen the wrinkles turn into creases. Use your best judgement and you\u2019ll be fine.The outfit photo above also illustrates a great point: Just because it\u2019s summer doesn\u2019t mean you have to wear bright, flashy colors all the time. Surprisingly by sometimes choosing muted neutrals you\u2019ll stand out in a crowd. It\u2019s also proof that wearing clothes in subdued shades diminishes the preppiness of it, if that\u2019s a concern for you.6. The Canvas Strap WatchTimex, $41/Casio, $98/MVMT, $269Sweat can do some nasty things to your wardrobe. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve experienced the stankiness that appears once you\u2019ve been wearing a metal, or especially leather, watch strap all summer. The leather starts rubbing off and smells like a high school gym locker.Reaching instead for a canvas NATO or Zulu strap watch will give you a washable solution that also adds texture, detail, and a pop of color to the rest of your outfit. Originally invented by the British military to provide an extra layer of security for keeping a watch on in tough conditions, the slip-thru design offers an easy way to swap out straps depending on what you\u2019re wearing for the day.Read more about NATO and ZULU watches in ourwatch strap guide.7. The Weekend BagBy the time summer rolls around we\u2019re all ready to get the hell out of Dodge. Every man needs a great weekend bag so he can swing home on a Friday, grab some gear and his partner, and hit the road.Your luggage doesn\u2019t need to be ugly and the best weekend bags balance cargo space with size. For as low as $40 you can get a great-looking bag that easily carries everything you need for a weekend trip.We recently posted our guide to theBest Weekend Bags Under $150, head here for the links and watch the video!Subscribe to Primer on Youtube8. The Fitted Short Sleeve ShirtAmazon, $18(similar)There\u2019s an absurdly false style rule perpetuated on style forums across the internet that you should never wear a short sleeve button up shirt. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, and by casting them aside you\u2019re limiting your summer wardrobe even more.This myth was started with good intentions \u2013 if you remember the 90\u2019s and onward were flooded with short sleeve button up shirts that were not only too baggy and boxy, the sleeves would be way too big and would jet off at an angle.I wouldn\u2019t want to look like this either:Read ourHow an Untucked Shirt Should Fit \u2013 A Complete Guide to Button-Ups, T-Shirts, & Polosto learn how to get the right fit.As with everything with your personal style, the focus to making this look sharp as hell is by honing in on the fit. Of primary concern is the looseness of the shoulders and the bagginess of the body. Similar to my polo guide above, you want a sleeve that hugs the upper arm \u2013 but is not tight \u2013 landing about half to three fourths of the way down. The body should glide down the side of your torso, offering enough room for movement and comfort but without any excess for billowing.9. The Wild Card ShortsAbercrombie & Fitch, $60(similar)To keep things fresh with your summer wardrobe I like to include something I call The Wild Card Shorts. These are a detour from your other flat front shorts mentioned above. While the fit should remain the same, by having a pair of shorts that experiments with texture, material, or pattern you can build entirely different getups with the same shirt and shoes. The ones shown above are a linen-cotton blend and it\u2019s the lighter color and texture of the linen that accentuates the button up shirt.10. The Smart SneakerNew Republic, $98/Nothing New, $70/Nike, $110/Sperry, $44(similar)Second only to the loafer in versatility and style is the smart sneaker. I\u2019ve mentioned a number of times how your footwear choice is really the defining variable in whether your outfit is more casual or more dressy. Imagine the outfit above with the driving mocs \u2013 especially with the linen, it becomes a very dressy ensemble.But with the gray canvas sneakers, the outfit is grounded as well-dressed casual. To take an extra step away from just sneakers towards intentionality, I swapped the athletic lacesfor a set of leather onesthat I picked up at Target for $5. It\u2019s a cheap upgrade with a huge effect.Just like with the boat shoes and sandals, let your ankles witness the world by going sockless. If sneakers without socks sound miserable, pick up someno-show socksthat sit below the shoe opening.There are plenty of classic sneakers to choose from, start your searchwith Sperry Sneakers..11. The Short Sleeve HenleyAmazon, $15(similar) /Buck Mason(shown)Sometimes you just want to wear a t-shirt. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that; but instead of choosing some standard screen printed tee, go for something with a little more dimension.A short sleeve henley provides the comfort and heat control of a t-shirt, but the button placket makes it so much more. Just as with the polo and short sleeve button up, fit is paramount. You\u2019re looking for one that looks trim without being tight. Follow the fit rules outlined for the polo above.12. Slim Fit ChinosJ.Crew, $98(similar)While you may hear chinos and think dress pants, worn with a properly fitted silhouette, they can be worn casually as shown here. Paired with the henley and the canvas sneakers, the look remains completely casual, while offering temperature control on cooler days or in the evenings. They\u2019re also perfect for lunch or dinner while at the beach or to a casual bar that you wouldn\u2019t want to wear shorts to.Be extra mindful of a leg opening that\u2019s too wide, this simple detail can kill the whole look.13. Sharp Dressed SunglassesAJ Morgan, $24As with the cargo shorts, sport shades by the likes of Oakley, et. al, have a superior place when performance is a concern. But when you\u2019re heading out to brunch with your date or going to an outdoor summer work function, endurance needs to take a back seat to form. Luckily, if you don\u2019t like making choices, there are only two primary forms the \u201cdress\u201d sunglass comes in. Aviator,preferably squareversusMaverick\u2019s tear drop, or theWayfarer/Clubmaster. If any of these feel too old school for you, there are plenty of modern takes that slim or tweak the design. A great place to look for these versions are modern trendy places likeWarby Parkeror surf and skate places likePacSun, which sell performance and lifestyle shades.14. The Summer ScentDolce & Gabbana Light Blue, $146Putrid: No word better describes the agony of sitting in a car on a scorching day with a dude wearing a strong winter cologne. \u201cWait, what\u2019s a winter or summer cologne,\u201d you say? It all comes down to the notes. Deep, rich scents like wood, leather, and tobacco are best for fall and winter, where the dry cold doesn\u2019t enhance the strength. Lighter, airy notes like orange, lemon, greens, vanilla, and honey are fresh and crisp but don\u2019t become overpowering when heat and sweat are added. When you swing by the cologne counter start your search with Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue, a fresh, citrus-y cologne.15. The Webbed BeltAmazon, $10When you have a solid color shirt and a solid color pair of pants, you need to introduce some visual variety. Taking a cue from the NATO strap watches, you can employ a webbed, surcingle, or cotton belt, which can lighten a look with a solid color or add depth with a pattern like stripes. Be careful though: You don't want to get too matchy-matchy with your watch strap and belt, they should both complement the outfit, not each other.What are your summer style essentials?

As your palate gains the ability to distinguish differences and your specific preferences take shape, it\u2019s the most subtle of details that determine your personal tastes and how you experience new whiskies.Things like \u201cfinish\u201d and \u201clegs\u201d factor in to your analysis, when in the beginning it all tasted like fire.Style is exactly the same.When you\u2019re first starting out, it\u2019s hard to know what you\u2019re looking at. You\u2019ll soon be able to see different styles broadly \u2013 preppy, street style, menswear \u2013 and as you gravitate to one, your likes and dislikes emerge. \u201cI don\u2019t like this pattern, I like this kind of fit, this is too colorful.\u201d The farther down you go, your appreciation for specific details start to define your own style.HenleyConsider the outfitShaneis wearing: Broadly speaking, it\u2019s a t-shirt and chino shorts. But place it next to some bro at a bbq and the tiny \u2013 but essential \u2013 nuances of these specific items become abundantly clear.This is one of the most essential principles when dressing well with affordable brands. With an unlimited budget, it\u2019s easy to find staples that have stylish details \u2013 that is exactly what fashion designers do. In fact, it\u2019d probably beharderto find expensive designer options thatdon\u2019thave unique attributes that make them stand out. Things like the width of collars, shapes of hems, intentionally longer, slimmer, or baggier cuts, unique textures, and so on.HenleyWhen on a budget, these are the types of details to look out for when shopping for simple basics that have a more nuanced style, and consequently look more expensive than they are. This is because people will assume your attention to detail has led you to overpriced designers.The struggle for beginners is balancing uniqueness with flashiness. Those new to dressing well often over-correct with picking unique items that stand out in a louder way. There\u2019s nothing wrong with wearing items like this, but the eccentricity of a garment is directly proportional to how long you can wear it. The trendier or flashier an item is, the shorter it will be stylish, generally speaking. To nail this style principle it\u2019s all about finding items that play on the classic elements of aclosetstaple in very subtle ways.Take thisshort-sleeve henley from L.A.-based Buck Mason, for example. Four buttons at the collar create a longer, vintage-inspired placket, while the banded sleeves and curved hem add trendy, stylish touches which sets it apart from your basic tee that gets lost in your dresser drawer. At $50, it\u2019s not much more than a henley you\u2019d find at competing mall retailers, but it sports far greater quality. The soft and durable pima cotton is a solid investment, as it will instantly become one of the most durable, versatile pieces in your summer wardrobe.

Mornings might be crisp, afternoons can get warm, and by evening, you\u2019re dodging rain or dealing with humidity. Our clothing should reflect that transition. That means layers that work with shifting temperatures, colors that feel brighter and more alive, and fabrics that anticipate summer instead of holding onto winter.\u201cMore importantly, people don\u2019t seem to know what to do with their AC during this time\u2014they either blast it or turn it off completely\u2014so it\u2019s important to be prepared for anything,\u201dPrimer style contributor Daniel Barakaexplains about his outfit that embodies everything spring dressing is about\u2014practical, adaptable, and optimistic.His approach isn\u2019t just about looking good in one outfit\u2014it\u2019s about understanding what makes spring style distinct from fall and how to dress for it with confidence.

They\u2019re very different from fall and winter. Spring is a time for a lighter palette. The days are getting longer, flowers are blooming, and I love to lean into pastels\u2014pinks, yellows, oranges. These colors add optimism to the day and feel very different from the sweaters I wear in the fall,\u201d says Daniel.Spring color isn\u2019t just about swapping dark shades for pastels\u2014it\u2019s aboutadjusting the overall tone of your outfit. Daniel\u2019s sweater uses a bright but grounded contrast color, signaling the transition toward summer.His striped t-shirt underneath continues that theme, moving away from winter\u2019s muted tones. \u201cI love when outfits feel like they\u2019re anticipating summer. As the days get brighter, your color palette should reflect that instead of sticking with the earth tones of fall and winter.\u201d Instead of holding onto browns, deep greens, and burgundy, spring is the time to start introducing lighter, fresher colors that feel more energetic and forward-looking.Banana RepublicUniqloBonobosHow to Add Spring Color Without Overdoing It:Start with one lighter-toned piece\u2014like a sweater in salmon, soft blue, or dusty yellow\u2014and balance it with neutrals. If pastels feel too bold, try muted versions instead.

It's a classic, thoughtful look that works together amazingly.But what about the guy who wants to always look intentional and well-dressed but can't spare the brain power to figure out if \u201cthis pattern goes with this texture over this color\u201d?The answer is,literally, simple.

If you\u2019re saying, \u201cminimalist style is for hipsters and nerds\u201d give us a chance to change your mind.Minimalist fashion has the potential to be both very simple and very effective, so we\u2019ve put together a guide to what it is and how to use it.Cashmere sweater (similar):Everlane, $64more sizes:Amazon, $49/ Watch:MVMT, $140/ Jeans (shown in header for a more casual look):Levi's, $69/ Dress pants (similar to shown here):Uniqlo, $40/ Sneakers (similar):Adidas, $50What Is Minimalist Style?\u201cMinimalism\u201d traditionally refers to movements or styles in various forms of art and design. It came about in the 1960s and 70s as a reaction to fine art that had become \u2013 in the eyes of minimalists \u2013 stale and academic. Unaffected, un-representational, and defined by simple geometric shapes, it was pretty radical at the time.In the words of architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the motto of minimalist art could be \u201cLess is more.\u201dWhen it comes to fashion, \u201cminimalism\u201d can mean different things to different people. For Instagram influencers and self-styled digital nomads, it can mean committing yourself to a bare-bones wardrobe of a half dozen or so carefully chosen pieces \u2013 the sartorial equivalent of chucking nearly all your stuff, moving into a tiny house, and sharing a toothbrush with your partner.To those of us who aren\u2019t steeped in fashion history, it can carry a whiff of pretension. \u201cMinimalist style,\u201d you might say, \u201cmakes me think of sipping an unctuous chianti at a Friday art opening.\u201dFor our purposes, it means stripping out superfluous items and creating a simpler, more intentional look based aroundless.In practice,minimaliststyle means:Monochromatic or limited color paletteHigh quality materialsExtremely good fitSparse use of patternsCarefully selected accentsReserved, functional and aesthetic vibeNow, take a look at that list\u2026 isn\u2019t thatkindawhat we all strive for anyway, minus the no-patterns rule? \u201cReserved, functional, and aesthetic\u201d could be thesecondPrimer motto, right after \u201ceffective, practical, and affordable.\u201dWhy Is Minimalist Style Compelling?There\u2019s two things that make minimalist style worth consideration. First, it transmitsintention. Show up to a party wearing a simple, well-fitting, carefully chosen t-shirt and jeans and it\u2019s making a statement \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t need to layer thing on thing on thing to have great, intentional style.\u201dSecond, stripping your look down to its most excellent essentials means you you can dress well and incredibly simply while using fewer pieces for more occasions. By transmitting intention, minimalist style is actuallymore dressy, even if it\u2019s just a shirt and pants.There may be less variation across your minimalist wardrobe, but you\u2019re well dressed more often because it works across venues, events, and social settings.That, in turn, means you can put less mental bandwidth into your style choices \u2013 by having fewer, but more well-chosen items in rotation you always know you\u2019re going to look aces\u2026with less thought required.Why Do People Criticize Minimalist Style?The main critique: minimalist style lacks personality, unique features, or anything approaching flash. The cynical argue, \u201cDressing minimalist is easy: black shirt, black jeans, black shoes.\u201d That, however, is a misreading of minimalism as a style approach.Raglan crew sweatshirt (similar):Old Navy, $25/ Watch:Timex, $80Jeans:Levi's, $41/ Sneakers:Converse, $546 Tips For Using Minimalist Style To Your AdvantageAs with any movement or school of thought that has its own \u201c-ist\u201d (Minimalist, Existentialist, Orthodontist), the key is to break the rules as needed to prevent yourself from being a carbon copy of someone less imaginative and less, well,you.1. Don\u2019t Wear Four Things When Three Will Do (And So On\u2026)We\u2019re big fans of layering. Search for \u201clayers\u201d on Primer and you\u2019ll getover 1800 results.Going minimalist, however, means carefully considering advice to layer up. When putting together an outfit, ask yourself: can I do this more simply than before? What are the essentials that make this look work?It means reconsidering a style approach that mirrors our broader cultural obsession with business \u2013 how can your personal style be less busy, and more effective at presenting you? Practically speaking, it may mean ditching thebutton up shirtunder your sweater or opting for similarly-shaded solids over plaids.In the words of the ancient knight in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, \u201cchoose wisely.\u201dWhich brings us to the second tip\u20262. Don\u2019t Wear Three Colors When Two Will Do (And So On)Simple, monochromatic colors. No logos. Avoid patterns. Black, white, grey, navy, olive are enough for most applications.Playing with color in your look is fun. Minimalist style means limiting yourself to one or two primary colors in an outfit. The effect can be dramatic: button-up and pants can take on a fashion-forward look impossible if you were to jam more colors into your palette.Take another example: what\u2019s more simple \u2013 and iconic \u2013 than a white t-shirt and jeans? Especially if the fit is on point, which brings us to\u20263. Be Insane About FitWhether you\u2019re trimming your closet to 15 essential workhorse pieces, or just endeavoring to dress more simply, minimalist style demands excellent fit.Rocking a black t-shirt and gray jeanscanhave you looking emo like you did in high school \u2013 unless the cut is spot on. Then it becomes intentional and exciting.Fit doesn\u2019t mean slim-all-the-way, either. Simply this:properfit, whatever it is, foryour body type.4. Go Ahead, Use Bright Colors If You WantTangerine, plum, saffron, mustard\u2026 bringing in bold accent colors for one of your clothing items is totally in bounds.

Cole Haan's shoe styles were still somewhat conservative, but their men's jackets had a rebellious flare that quickly seduced me. After a year, I'd racked up $2000 worth of jackets (though I won't say how much I actually paid with my employee discount). It's been well over a decade, and I still have all of those jackets\u2026and several more.When you throw your jacket on in the morning, you setthe tone for your day. Like choosing between loafers or workboots, choosing between different types of jackets is a matter of formandfunction. What's the temperature? Could it rain or snow? Am I feeling formal, casual, business, or athletic today? Your jacket choice is the result of these decisions.But sometimes, you might not know where to start. We've compiled a list of the most common men's jacket styles. Keep the list going in the comments if we didn't include your favorite or if you have experience with any of our picks.Table of ContentsField JacketBarn JacketMotorcycle Field JacketBomber JacketChore CoatDenim JacketTrucker JacketShirt JacketHarrington JacketLeather JacketBiker JacketFleece JacketPea CoatShearling JacketMac JacketPuffer JacketVestCoach JacketWaxed Canvas JacketBlazerRain CoatPackable JacketParkaSuede JacketTechnical JacketFishtail ParkaQuilted JacketVarsity JacketOvercoatField JacketSimilar:Propper/Fall Getup Week: That Blur Between the End of Summer and Fall WeatherThefield jacketis one of the few sartorial pieces that perfectly mates form with function, meaning 1) It will never go out of style, and 2) You'll always have a spare pocket for your keys. The field jacket is easily recognizable as it typically has 3-4 exterior pockets and a generous fit (so you can layer up underneath). The originalM-65 field jacketwas developed in tandem with NYCO, a cotton/nylon blend that offered improved water and wind resistance over previous iterations.Today, outerwear companies have gotten creative with their fabrics, offering field jackets in cotton canvas,waxed canvas, and cotton blends.As the design evolved, it branched into three main styles: themilitary field jacket(based on the M-65), thebarn-style field coat(country and workwear-inspired), and themotorcycle field jacket(belted and waxed for weather and speed). Each traces its roots to the same purpose-built heritage, adapted for a different environment.Barn Jacket or FieldCoatA barn jacket over ashawl collar cardigan sweaterThe barn jacket comes from a different field, literally. It was designed for work around farms and barns, built from heavy cotton canvas or waxed cotton with a boxier cut and a soft corduroy collar. Where the field jacket\u2019s structure comes from military design, the barn jacket\u2019s comfort comes from rural practicality. It often includes flannel or quilted lining for warmth, patch pockets placed lower on the body, and a more relaxed fit overall.There\u2019s clear overlap between the two: both are utilitarian, built for layering, and look better with age. The field jacket leans precise and tactical, the barn jacket leans easy and broken-in. One feels ready for a mission, the other for a long walk through wet leaves, but both embodytimeless, functional outerwear that never feels out of place.Live Action Getup: The Everyday Outfit You Can Count OnBrands like Barbour,L.L.Bean, and Orvis popularized the modern versions. TheBarbour BedaleandBeaufortin particular represent the classic countryside field coat: water-resistant, durable, and refined enough for the city. While the field jacket feels military and structured, the barn jacket feels relaxed and ready for anything.Read more about field jackets:The 10 Best Field JacketsHow to wear a field jacket:Live Action Getup: Colder Weather Casual LayersFall Getup Week: Light Fall LayersLive Action Getup: Upgrading Your Lazy CasualLive Action Getup: Autumn Layers in the CityMotorcycle Field JacketLive Action Getup: Spring TransitionThe Belstaff Jacket (originally spelledBellstaffand often called the \u201cmoto\u201d) was introduced in 1924 in Staffordshire, England. The goal was straightforward: make durable, weatherproof gear for motorcyclists. They used Egyptian cotton treated with wax, creating one of the first breathable yet water-resistant fabrics in commercial outerwear.Unlike the military field jacket or the rural barn coat, the motorcycle field jacket was engineered for movement and protection. It\u2019s longer than a typical leather moto, often belted at the waist to stay secure while riding, and reinforced at key seams. The four symmetrical front pockets and high, buckle-fastening collar weren\u2019t decorative: They served practical needs for tools, maps, and shielding from wind.A motorcycle field jacketThe design became standard gear for British riders in the mid-20th century and later caught on as rugged everyday wear. TheBelstaff Trialmasterand Barbour International remain the two definitive examples, both using waxed cotton and a structured cut that still feels modern.Today\u2019s versions carry the same purpose-built DNA, bridging function and style in a way few jackets manage. A waxed moto field jacket offers weather protection, shape, and attitude without the bulk or heat of leather.How to wear a moto jacket:This Live Action Getup Proves an Important Fashion ConceptBomber JacketYou probably know that thebomber jacket was originally created for pilots, but you may not know that the streamlinedsilhouetteyou see today was at the outset, crafted from seal leather and lined with fur. Over the decades, the bomber has seen several iterations, loosening its insulation requirements as airplane cockpits have become warmer.Today thebomber jacket is the throw-it-on-for-anything jacketin terms of style: Going to the store in your sweats for milk? Throw on your bomber. Going out for drinks with the fellas? Bomber. And with different colors, cuts, and levels of warmth available, you can have a different bomber for each season.

By definition, a coat is an outer garment for the upper body, a jacket is the shorter cousin, everyday language stretches both.Some jackets go past the hips, some coats stop short. The M65 field jacket runs to the thigh, brands and the public call it a jacket, the original military spec even labeled it a coat. Pea coats sit at the hip, car coats land mid-thigh, topcoats come lighter than overcoats, so length and weight refuse to play hall monitor.A coat is usually your outermost, weatherproof, insulating layer (overcoats, topcoats, trench coats). A jacket might be short, light, tailored, rugged, or warm depending on context (field jackets, sport coats, leather jackets, bombers). Parkas are often treated as jackets, some sources list them as coats too.Why the overlap, and why the names that ignore logic. History and function set the families, culture cements the labels. Sport coats started as country-sport gear, now a tailored jacket worn without matching trousers. Trench coats take their name from construction and military origin, warmth varies.Bottom line, labels follow style families and history, not strict measurements, so expect exceptions.Denim JacketDenim Trucker Jacket:Levi's/AmazonPlenty of companies make a denim jacket, but no on does it quite like Levi's. The denim, or jean jacket dates back to the late 1800s. It was originally created for farmers and gold prospectors with seams that could be easily let out and moved if the wearer needed a looser fit. When you picture a denim jacket, you probably see this one fromLevi's, which is their classicTrucker Jacket.The metal buttons and v-shaped seams make it unmistakable. Suitable for a spring day with a light breeze, a summer evening, or a fall evening with layers, the denim jacket has a rugged casualness that looks laid back but intentional.We feature it regularly in our outfit inspiration due to its versatility amongsmart casual.It's important to note that while the denim trucker jacket is the most ubiquitous, there are other types of jackets that can be made of denim, most commonly a chore coat:Tellason made in USA denim chore coatRead more about denim jackets:What\u2019s The Difference Between A Trucker Jacket And A Denim Jacket?How to wear:Live Action Getup: The Black Denim JacketMedium wash denim jacketAll from Amazon: 3 Fall Outfits I Styled for the Amazon Style StoreLight denim jacketGray denim jacketTrucker JacketJacket:Flint & Tinder Waxed Trucker JacketThetrucker jacket has an intriguing history, from protecting cowboys from storms to keepingRobert Redford looking like a stud.

But you know how it goes when you get pressure washin'. Next thing I know I'm doing the back porch, and then I started eyeing up the deck.

I threw on jeans, suede chukkas, a sweatshirt, and my leather jacket, and I felt smooth. The leather jacket is the ultimate feather in the cap ofsmart casual: It's intentional without being presumptuous.Leather jackets can come in lots of different styles, from the classic racer style to bombers, blazers, and everything in between. The most famous style is probably the double rider: The classic leather jacket with big collars and asymmetrical zipper, shown in its own section below.The first commercially available leather jacket was released in the early 1900s for motorcyclists; if you fell, the leather would take the brunt of the road rash instead of your own skin (it took a while to figure out that helmets were a good idea too).This Classic Nike High Top is the Sneaker We\u2019re Wearing This FallMarlon Brando and James Dean wore leather jackets inThe Wild OneandRebel Without a Causerespectively, and suddenly it was the sartorial staple of the 1950s.

Biker jackets feature a trim cut (so they're not great for layering), a short torso (so you can easily lean over the side of your bike without having a button dig into your pelvis), and ample hardware for ruggedness. While the double rider biker jacket lends itself to a more casual look, it actually complements ashirt and tie quite well. Pairing your work wear with a little bit of renegade is always a cool move.Fleece JacketJacket shown:Amazon EssentialsWhen I hear polyester, my mind goes toSaturday Night Fever, but the polyester of today is not the polyester of the 1970s when your dad wore platform shoes and shirts with collars points down to his armpits. Today's polyester fleece is lightweight, soft, and breathable, allowing you to stay warm and (relatively) dry without breaking a sweat.It won't shrink when you dry it, and because it's a synthetic fabric, it keeps its shape. The best part? You don't need to drop $100 to get a more-than decent fleece jacket. This fleece from Amazon comes in 26 styles and hits a price point that won't make you cringe.Pea CoatLive Action Getup: Classic in Any EraThe pea coat is one of the few coats that has seen very little change since its inception. Why? Because it's hard to update perfect. Like quite a few men's coats, the pea coat finds its roots in the military,originally crafted in the 1700s for Dutch sailorsfrom rough, thick wool. The term \u201cpea\u201d is thought to come from the Dutch word \u201cpij\u201d or \u201cpije\u201d (depending on the source), which described the wool.The British navy popularized the style, and we're still wearing them today. The modern pea coat is slightly more fitted than the original, but the oversized collar, hem just below the waist, and double-breasted button closure remain. And because a classic never dies, plenty of companies have their own take on thepea coat, meaning you can choose the one that fits your personal taste and your budget.Get a good one:These Are The 23 Best Men's Pea Coats, Car Coats, Walker Coats, and OvercoatsHow to wear a pea coat:Live Action Getup: Remixing 4 Other Outfits to Create a New OneSpectre Style: Casual Style Inspired by Daniel Craig\u2019s James BondA Classic Cold Weather Capsule Wardrobe With A Modern Edge + 10 Getups!Starting Time: Building an Outfit Around a Seiko Dive WatchFantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them: Menswear at the MoviesThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou: Menswear at the MoviesStarting Time: Building an Outfit Around a Timex WaterburyShearling JacketLevi's shearling trucker jacketThe shearling jacket hits that sweet spot when it's too cool for a trucker but too warm for a pea coat. If you go for genuine shearling, which comes from sheep, you'll spend a few hundred at least (and that's if you catch a deal).Levi'sLuckily faux-fur shearling (which is essentially hi-pile, textured fleece and labeled as \u201csherpa\u201d) retains warmth nearly as well as the real thing. It's also easier to maintain (because you can wash it), and it won't mat down as easily as genuine shearling. A sherpa trucker like this one is soft and easy to wear like a heavy sweatshirt.Mac JacketBrock McGoffThe Mackintosh, or Mac\u2026or rain coat actually dates back to the 1800s. Charles Mackintosh, a chemist, devised a way to insert a layer of liquid rubber between an interior and exterior layer of fabric. And the Mac was born. Traditionally a Mac was cut for wear over a suit, but the modern Mac is slightly tailored. You can certainly layer it over a suit or a thicksweater, but you don't have to.Trench CoatHow to Wear a Trench Coat Without Looking Like a 1930s DetectiveTrench coats became iconic after service by British officers in World War I, but their story starts almost a century earlier, as a response to the popularity of the Mackintosh coat. Traditionally trench coats are below the knee, double breasted and feature wide lapels, and a waist belt, though you can find coats labeled as trench coats that feature other styles.Puffer Jacket10 Best Winter Jackets That Prioritize Warmth But Are Still StylishThe puffer jacket is your quintessential winter jacket. It's lightweight, it's warm, and it has just enough moisture resistance to get you through a snow shower.There's nothing wrong with an extra puffy puffer jacket, but anymore, insulation technology has allowed for more svelte options likethis onefrom L.L. Bean with down that's been treated to allow it to stay dry even when wet.VestAlso known as a gilet, the vest is one type of outerwear men sleep on the most. It's the perfect layer for those frustrating-to-dress-for days where a thicker coat would be too hot after a certain point. The torso-covering vest keeps heat in while not insulating the arms, a way of regulating body temperature while also looking damn cool.Check outPrimer's guide to this turtleneck and vest combowhich will have you looking as sharp as style contributor Daniel Baraka and not an old guy on the ski lift.Coach JacketThe history of the coach's jacket is in the name. In the 90s, this lightweight windbreaker-style jacket (complete with snap button closure) was worn by NFL coaches all over the country (with a big ol' team logo on the back). It moves easily; it resists moisture in case it starts to drizzle, and snap buttons mean it goes on and off easily so the coach can stay comfortable without missing a play.Waxed Canvas JacketShown:Rogue Territory Ridgeline Supply Jacket featured inNo Time to DieThismay be the best damn looking jacket on the entire list, and I'm not just saying that because Daniel Craig wears it inNo Time to Die.Ok\u2026that might have something to do with it.

This is where the traditional rain coat comes into play.If you're like me, you're thinking that all that waterproofing doesn't allow for a lot of air movement. But this jacket has a trick up it's sleeve: zippered vents with lightweight mesh to keep moisture out while allowing for air flow.AnorakThe word anorak comes from the native Greenalndic languageannoraaq. Similar to a parka (itself having native Russian etymology), an anorak is a hooded, pullover hip-length jacket usually made of nylon to provide wind and water protection. They've regained fashion popularity in the last two decades or so and often come in bright solid colors or a mix of bright colors. Due to their pull-over style, nylon construction, and zipper pouch, anoraks arecasual wearjackets, often chosen for weather utility.Packable JacketShown:Amazon/ Upgrade:Ralph LaurenIn the back of my SUV, I have a fleece blanket, amultitool, and a packable jacket. Why? Because dammit you just never know. And let's be honest: the packable jacket is just cool. Here's a piece of clothing that will keep you warmandneatly pack into itself for easy storage \u2013 there's something profound in its simplicity. This one fromAmazonis made from nylon (which will cut the wind and resist moisture) with polyester filling for added insulation. And at $45 with 11 color options, it's a no-brainer.ParkaShown:PatagoniaWhen the elements are kicking your ass, you reach for the parka. Originally made from seal skin by the Caribou Inuits, the parka is a garment designed for true cold weather activity and is one of the best types of jackets to stay warm in the winter. The body is cut below the waist, the interior is insulated (usually with down or a down alternative), and pockets have storm flaps and buttons (or velcro). This one from Patagonia is made with recycled 600-fill down, stretch canvas, and a hood that will cover your head and neck. Winter's got nothin' on you.Suede JacketThis is the Leather Jacket Style Every Guy Can Pull OffThe best part about a suede jacket is that every guy canmake it work. The suede racer compliments any body shape and looks as good at the bar as it does at the office. Suede gives you the durability of leather, but it breathes better and has a soft hand.Technical JacketThe North FaceThe first jacket I ever bought from The North Face was anApex. I was 22, fresh out of school, and the Apex was my graduation gift to myself. That was 13 years ago, and it's still hanging in my closet. A tech jacket (named for the tech fabric from which it's made) is the Swiss Army knife of jackets: it's warm, it cuts the wind, and it's waterproof (the Apex uses a proprietary fabric with a polyurethane coating, which allows the fabric to breathe while keeping moisture out).If there's rain in the forecast, and you're going for a hike or traversing the city, the tech jacket won't let you down.Fishtail ParkaThe Essentials: Gray Denim \u2013 6 Complete Outfits That Prove It Will Change Your WardrobeThe name says it all: the fishtail parka is cut long in the body with a short vent at the bottom of the back, which kind of looks like a\u2026well\u2026you get it.This onefrom Alpha Industries is made from a cotton/poly blend for high breathability while still keeping you dry. The front placket adds a layer of moisture resistance while the drawstrings let you decide how tapered you want the fit.Quilted JacketSimilar:Ralph LaurenIn the springtime, my default weekend outfit is jeans and asolid t-shirt. A simple way to enhance this look is by adding a little texture, and this is what a quilted jacket does best. The quilted jacket has a way of looking fancy yet casual; call it, \u201claid-back-equestrian.\u201dThe quilted jacket is ideal for layering, so throw it over a sweatshirt to cut the wind and lock in a little extra body heat. This one from Ralph Lauren is handsomely classic.How to wear it:There\u2019s No Shame in Being a Jeans & T-Shirt Guy: Here\u2019s How to Do It IntentionallyVarsity JacketPhoto by Trav WhiteUnfortunately they didn't give out varsity jackets if you were the lead in the musical (not that I'm bitter), but I prefer the kind without letters on them anyway. The varsity jacket traditionally has a wool body with leather sleeves, an American cut (which is to say a bit boxy), and a team's logo on it. These days the varsity jacket has a slightly trimmer cut, and most are made from blends of fleece or cotton. But if you want the real thing, check outthis onefrom Champion.OvercoatI have a problem with overcoats because they look so damn good over a suit or a navy blazer. So I have four of them. The overcoat is cut long in the body with a little extra room in the chest and sleeves to go over your suit for work.The Only 4 Ways to Tie a Scarf You\u2019ll Ever NeedPerhaps more than any other coat on the list, overcoats come in at every price point you can imagine from low-cost options to exorbitantly expensive that costs more than my first car. Camel, navy, or black are the most traditional choices, but don't be afraid togo off the beaten pathwith a pattern.Two Winter Outfits That Will Get You Through 90% of the Rest of the SeasonRead more:These Are The 23 Best Men's Pea Coats, Car Coats, Walker Coats, and OvercoatsHow to wear an overcoat:Live Action Getup: Dressed Up CasualLive Action Getup: Dressed Down Winter ItemsThe Getup: All from Sale Fall MinimalistLive Action Getup: Winter in the CityFinally, Guys Under 6\u2032 Have A Way To Look Great This WinterLive Action Getup Joshua Tree",

      "body": "1. Makeyour first suit purchaseacharcoal two button with notch lapels.2. Afour-in-handis the right tie knot 98.6% of the time.3. Wool socks > cotton socks. Andthey\u2019re worth the price.4.Laundromatsare a fact of life. The machines will also lie about the temperature settings and cook your clothes.5. Dark wash denim will never go out of style\u20266. \u2026unless they\u2019ve been cut into jean shorts.7. Being overdressed may get you snide comments. It\u2019ll also get you the job (or the date).8. That said, no one likes a show off.Know the difference between effort and peacocking.9. Learn toiron.10. And sew on a button.11. And while you\u2019re at it,how to shine(read: polish) some dress shoes.12. Find a good tailor you trust.They can make affordable clothing look amazing on you.13. But you tailor also can\u2019t do a thing about shoes that don\u2019t fit right. Be particular about shoes and prioritize your feet.14. Wearing cologne is a team sport. It\u2019s up to the wearer to anticipate who does and who does not want to be on their team on any given day, in any given situation.15. Blues, grays, browns, black.That\u2019s the foundation.16.A crisp white dress shirtwith a nice looking semi spread collar is rarely the wrong call.17. Dry-clean your suits and sportcoats only when absolutely necessary (sweat, smoke, or other stink = necessary).18. 80% of the time you can steam it instead of fully dry cleaning it. It\u2019ll look and feel refreshed. Soinvest in a steamer.19. Build a habit oftrying a little more than you have to. Like when you\u2019re getting on a flight, when grocery shopping, or when home alone. Practice builds confidence, and it\u2019ll be therethe day you really need it.20. Body hair (pits, chest, groin) is part ofbeing a mammal. You\u2019re allowed totrim it. But shaving it is asking for trouble.21. There areinternational standardsfor distance (meters,) time (seconds,) and mass (kilos). But a 32\u2033 waist or medium shirt size will never,everfit the same from brand to brand.22. If your barber says \u201cwant me to hit those eyebrows?\u201d it\u2019s probably not a question, and the answer is almost certainly \u201cyes, thanks.\u201d23. \u201cAccessories = Last things on, first things noticed.\u201d So keep it under control. More than two eye-catching accessories and you\u2019ll start to look likea one man band.24. Floss. Listen. Say thank you. Don\u2019t be pedantic. Get the door. Smile. Tip well. Drink plenty of water. Sleep on it. Treat others with respect and dignity. Having style is about more than just what you wear.25. There are no rules. Only guidelines.",

      "body": "Men\u2019s Fall Style Essentials \u2013 Autumn 2010Say goodbye to summer. Fall is officially here. The official change of season doesn\u2019t happen until the equinox on September 23rd, but the new fall lines are fully in stores, the weather cooling off, and the NFL and College Football seasons are underway. Now\u2019s the time to putthat linen suitback into storage for another year, and reload your closet with a few heavier, darker, but just as interesting pieces suitable for the new season. Here\u2019s a few of the best bets that are neither too trendy nor too expensive, & ready for this year\u2019s downshift into cooler weather..The Subtle Dark Pattern Suit in Houndstooth, Plaid, or HerringboneThree options ranging from $110 - $560Express Stretch WoolHoundstooth Jacket\u2013 $228.00|matching pant \u2013 $98.00INC PolyDark Plaid Blazer\u2013 $69.98|matching pant \u2013 $39.98J. Crew Italian WoolHerringbone Ludlow Jacket\u2013 $375.00|matching pant \u2013 $185.00Dark subtle patterns deliver the depth and textured look of a tweed without any of the scratchy old-time feel. From a distance they look solid but at arms length you\u2019ll notice there\u2019s a lot more going on. See the full review of the way better than expectedExpress houndstooth here. For the INC suit,the online picsdon\u2019t do it justice. Yes it\u2019s synthetic, but in person it actually feels decent & looks even better. The peaks on the lapels are barely there and set high enough making them blend in. The off the rack contouring is terrific. TheJ. Crew Herringbonewill obviously be superior and you\u2019ll pay for that name. But the pattern, cut, and finish are all unbeatable..The Bold Tattersall Shirt:Hickey Freeman \u2013 $71.99|J. Crew Point Collar \u2013 $55.00Not cheap, but unique in the right ways.It\u2019s fall, not a funeral. If you can\u2019t afford any of those new subtle pattern numbers up top, but still want to add detail to your somber and solid suits, splurge on a bold tattersall shirt. You only need one, and you get a similar depth-producing effect. Dark suit + Tattersall shirt + subdued tie = just enough character. If you need an even cheaper option, trythis one from Black Brown 1826through Lord and Taylor. Just $40..The Lighter Gray Blazer: B.R.Herringbone Blazer $250| GapWool Blend Blazer $98.00The most important piece to fall layeringNot charcoal, but instead a true to leaning light gray, both of these blazers from the GAP family of companies will give you shape while keeping you warm. Fail safe / can\u2019t screw it up layering ends when you put on a well tailored blazer. At $250 and made of Italian Cotton, the Banana Republic version is extremely high end (see thein person review here) while the just releasedGAP step down versionkeeps it more affordable..The New Detail Boot: U.O.Ritano Wingtip \u2013 $78.00|CAT Jonas \u2013 $129.00Fit for the weatherThe moc-toeclunky Lumberjacklook is everywhere. But in your gut, that should feel more like a trend than anything else. Tough to wear those to say, a concert. Instead, try a boot with details that are a little more versatile. Wingtip styling or moto inspired buckles specifically..The Beige Dial Watch \u2013 GuessEuro Chrono $135.00| TX500 Series World Time $325.84Perfect color for the seasonAs the immortal masters of poetryKris Kross once said: \u201cWarm it up\u2026\u201d (sorry). Look for a watch with a brown leather strap but not a matching face. Instead, look for a beige, off-white, or ivory dial. The case and details can be updated or as complicated as you\u2019d like, but the color of the dial gives it an old-time feel..Corduroy: Old NavyCord Blazer \u2013 $49.50| American RagStraight Leg Cords \u2013 $29.50Keep the fit and wale slim.A few suggestions for corduroy: Keep the wale small. Anything too big and you\u2019ll start to look like a couch from 1975. Don\u2019t stick to just brown. Black and Gray work just as well if not better. You\u2019ll see plenty of corduroy suits this fall\u2026 try to avoid those. And don\u2019t forget that one of the best places to pick up corduroy on the cheap is your local thrift store. The Old Navy Cord Blazer will have to be tailored in, but it\u2019s a bargain, and wears well. The American Rag cords are about as inexpensive as it gets and widely available..The Unique Leather Gloves:Firetrap Gloves \u2013 $67.40|Topman Side Knit Gloves \u2013 $32.00You'll thank me that first day you have to scrape your windshieldEverybody and their grandfather has a pair of leather gloves with the three lines of stitching on the top. Go for something slightly different. A d-ring buckle at the cuff, or something sorta out-there like the pair from Topman. Got a fast car and not afraid to spend a little money?These are available on blueflyfor $84.00 and offer classic racing style without any shiny obnoxious hardware..A Beard:Remington MB-200 Titanium Beard Trimmer \u2013 $24.99Fall is the time to lose sight of your babyface.I don\u2019t carewhat anybody says about how stubble or maintaining a weeks worth of growth has jumped the shark. If you keep your neck shaved, and you trim your beard to the same length with a beard trimmer (try setting #2 onthis Remmingtonfor Clooney\u2019s style above) you\u2019ll look plenty cleaned up. It\u2019s all about uniformity in the length of your facial hair.The ladies seem to like it, plus when the dog and I go for our morning run and it\u2019s 20 degrees or colder out, my skin doesn\u2019t turn waxy and peel off in dead chunks..The Drinks: Alaska Brewing Barley Wine, Zaya Rum, Lone Madrone RedsGoodbye Summer. Hello Barley Wine, Rum, and Reds.Thank goodness it\u2019s finally time to stop drinking Pilsners, Gin and Tonics, and Whites. Autumn calls for the deep, dark, and rich stuff. Read a full review of the Alaskan Brewing Barley Wine fromour friends at The Next Bar Stool(hint: it\u2019s surprisingly good.) Reacquaint yourself withone of the best sipping liquors, Zaya Rum, from our Drinks Correspondent Ben Madeska. And if you\u2019re into the wine scene, try any of the reds from the small Paso Robles / Highway 46 West wineryLone Madrone. Any and all will keep you sufficiently warm.Got any other fall-ready favorites? Leave them in the comments section below.",

But, trends can change from year to year, so we\u2019ll keep this list focused on what\u2019s big (and for good reason) for fall 2017. Specific, affordable examples of each are also included below. As always, these won\u2019t be \u201cessential\u201d to everyone. Far from it.They\u2019re more guidelines.A Quilted Jacket and/or VestBarbour International Ariel Quilt \u2013 $185 \u2013 $269Made in the UK Lavenham Quilted Vest \u2013$195FINALGAP Quilted Jacket \u2013$47.97@ 40% off ($79.95)Target Goodfellow & Co Quilted Vest \u2013 $24.99Barbour SLIM Fit Quilted Bomber \u2013$133.33($199)Brooks Brothers Horizontal Quilted Hybrid Jacket \u2013$199($398)J. Crew Sussex Quilted Jacket \u2013$138.60w/YESPLEASE($198)The funny thing about puffer vests and jackets is that they make you look\u2026 puffy. Opt for something lesslife-jacketlike. That quilting provides insulation AND it looks terrific (there\u2019s just something about those symmetrical lines). Remember, these are for casual use. So not to be worn with a suit or sportcoat.A Wool/Wool-blend Henley and/or Long Sleeve PoloUSA Made Triple Aught Design Primer Henley \u2013 $55.00J. Crew Italian Merino Wool Polo Sweater \u2013$62.65w/YESPLEASE($89.50)H&M Premium Quality Merino Wool Polo Shirt \u2013 $49.99B.R. Heritage Stripe Merino Wool-Silk Blend Henley \u2013$59.10($98.50)J. Crew Wool/Cotton Henley \u2018$55.65w/YESPLEASE($79.50)Western Rise Dryweight Merino Blend Henley \u2013 $98Henleys are a masculine classic that\u2019ll never go out of style. The long-sleeve polo is a bit of a throwback that\u2019s getting some good run this year. Both are thankfully now being made by major brands and retailers in a wool or wool blend. Wool is just so far superior to cotton, especially in more extreme temperatures.Medium to Lightweight GlovesOrivs Lambskin Driving Gloves \u2013$69($89)(just about sold out)Orvis Best-Grade Sporting Clays Gloves \u2013 $79(a nice alternative to the drivers?)Franklin Tailored Men\u2019s Nappa Snap Closure Glove \u2013 $79Autodromo Stringback Driving Gloves \u2013 $125For those mornings where you want to protect your hands from the wind but it\u2019s still not full blown heavy wool mitts or ski gloves weather. You want something that provides protection and a bit of warmth, but you don\u2019t lose much if any of your dexterity. It\u2019s a bit early in the season for gloves of any kind, but watch for them (especially at Nordstrom) to start showing up in the coming weeks.A Pair of Rugged, Do Anything BootsAllen Edmonds Higgins Mill Boot \u2013 $350(shown above in natural cxl)J.

They\u2019re somewhere between a dress boot and a true, sh*t kicking classically styled work boot. A slimmer toe box but still hefty leathers (depending on the price) and good support. Can\u2019t say enough about the Higgins Mill (shown above). Love mine. I havenottaken good care of them, but the Chromexcel uppers and subtly studded sole walk the line between utility and style, and can handle what I dish out for sure.A \u201cBrushed\u201d or Corduroy Button DownTarget Goodfellow & Co Corduroy Shirt \u2013 $24.99Ledbury Brushed Dot Shirt \u2013 $75 (sold out)J.

Boy howdy does it. Most men will default to just using the harsh, overhead lights that are in the ceiling of their house/apartment. But having a couple of well placed lamps can make a big difference in terms of how your place feels to you and your guests. Many of us spend far too much time under harsh overhead lighting at work. Bring it down to closer to eye level (or lower) at home, and you\u2019ll probably be pleased with the atmosphere it creates during the colder/darker months.A Signature Warm Cocktail or Drink and/or a Hearty MealDoesn\u2019t have to be an alcoholic drink.

But, it helps when you\u2019ve having guests over (or, bringing something to share to someone else\u2019s shindig) to have something autumnal in style in your culinary arsenal. So learn how to make greatcold weather cocktails, ora killer fall-inspired pizza. Whatever. Cooking is like getting dressed. It shows you can assemble and therefor create something greater than the sum of its parts.Again, there are always exceptions and these are more guidelines than anything.

      "body": "#1. Set your clothes out the night before.On a valet, the back of a chair, or aside in your closet. You\u2019ll feel better because you\u2019ll be in less of a rush, and you\u2019ll look better because you\u2019ll have planned ahead instead of making decisions while still groggy and waking up.#2. It\u2019s significantly easier toiron a shirtthat\u2019s been pulled early from the dryer and is still a little damp.#3. Shirts with a slightly lowered 2nd button (Ledbury, Proper Cloth, etc.) are worth the expense.No more getting stuckbetween unbuttoning just the top button and feeling too stuffy, and unbuttoning two buttons and showing too much chest.How a shirt with a (slightly) lowered 2nd button looks with the top undone.#4. When you finda good barber as well as a good tailor, stick with them, treat them well, and hold on to them for as long as you can. They\u2019ll help make you and your clothes look andfeelterrific.#5. Go to a good shoe store andget measured with a brannock device. After that,buy yourtrueshoe size and width. Not what youthinkyou should be or what you\u2019ve always worn. Your true actual size and width. If you\u2019re a wide, buy wide shoes and sneakers, and research lasts to find shoes with shapes that are more accommodating. Don\u2019t default to purchasing \u201cD only\u201d (medium width) shoes and sneakers. If you\u2019re a narrow width, have high arches, or other unique foot features, do your research, ask questions, and adapt accordingly. Your feet are your wheels. The rest of the car can look awesome, but if you\u2019ve got a bum wheel, it\u2019s no fun getting around.#6. Quick release watch bracelets and straps might feel a little cheesy, but they\u2019re 1000% easier to use than a spring bar tool. Which means you\u2019ll get a lot more wear for your watch investments, spendy or cheap.Quick release spring bars make it super easy to switch between straps and even bracelets,greatly increasing a watch\u2019s versatility.#7. Wear sunscreen early and often in your life. You know this. I know this. We all know this. But not all of us follow through. If you don\u2019t, it\u2019ll catch up to you. The sun\u2019s been aroundfor 4.5 billion years. It\u2019ll turn us all to dust long before it fizzles out.#8. You can save alotof money shopping at thrift stores, on ebay, and at TJ Maxx, Ross, etc. Additionally,you can spend a lifetimechasing dead ends at those places too.#9. Pleats on dress pants and suit trousers come and go in terms of style, butsinglepleats (just one pleat on either side of the center) are subtle, and most importantly make room for those of us with bigger backsides and thighs. And speaking of sartorial geometry\u2026gusseted casual pantswill change your life. Your \u201cundercarriage\u201d deserves good geometry too.#10. Suede shoes & boots aremuchmore versatile than most think. The matte texture looks good dressed up, dressed down, and in all seasons. They\u2019re alsoeasy to protectandclean.Suede shoes look great and don\u2019t need to be babied.Usea water/stain resistant spray, and they\u2019llhandle whatever life throws at them.#9. Anunlined sportcoat in hopsack woolisn\u2019t hot. At all. It also looks great with everything from a smart crewneck to a crisp dress shirt.#12. Eye-contact is cool as hell. Especially now that everyone is buried in their phones 24/7.No need to be a creep. But look people in the eye.#13. Posting every little thing on social media is the opposite of eye-contact. There\u2019s no connection, nooxytocin, and certainly no intrigue. It often feels desperate and sad and it\u2019s an easy trap to get pulled into. We\u2019re all \u201csharing\u201d but we\u2019re sharing alone. Documenting an event often means you\u2019re not truly experiencing it, so what does that mean whendocumenting one\u2019s life becomes standard? So yeah. It\u2019s hard, but try to turn the phone off every once in a while. Look up and look around.Make sure your stuff fits long before the day of a big event.#14. If you\u2019ve got a big event coming up,practice wearingwhat you\u2019re gonna wear a couple weeks in advance. Book a nice dinner out, or just wear it at home. It\u2019s like test driving a car or stretching and warming up before a big game. Enclothed cognition is real, but that axe swings both ways. Put on something you\u2019re not used to and you risk feeling (and looking) uncomfortable in it. You don\u2019t want to get out there \u201ccold\u201d and feel weird. Practice may not make perfect, but it does make comfortable. And that\u2019s key. Plus if it doesn\u2019t fit? You\u2019ll have time to find or facilitate a fix.#15. The fashion media (both new and legacy) is mostly full of shit. They have to make stuff up and push nonsense because too much of style (while relative) is stillstubbornly consistent and simple. Makingridiculousdeclarative statements and/or pushingloudif not obnoxious silliness is incentivized because it\u2019s the only way to cut through the noise now that every knucklhead with a smartphone canunilaterally declare themselves a style expert. But the internet isn\u2019t real life. Not in tone, visuals, emotion, or sensory perception.Dress for real life.Yourreal life.",

Subtle, studded soles like Dainite (or, Dainite knock offs) are always appreciated, being that they provide traction but don\u2019t look toothy like a true lug sole.#5.

      "body": "With the rise of more casual offices as well as the drastic increase inWork From Home(2024 update)Back to the Office, more and more people are dropping into the (somewhat dreaded) Business Casual level of workplace dress. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to look likeevery sitcom dad from the 1990s. Here are 10 ways to make Business Casual look, y\u2019know, actually kinda good. Because enclothed cognition is real. Look good, do great. Now who microwaved fish again??#1. Trim up your fitNumber one with a bullet. Even though fits have gotten much slimmer in the last decade (to a bad extreme in many cases)\u2026 the business casual workplace is still littered with oversized dress shirts and bulky khakis. Clothes should ride close to your frame, without constricting it. They should skim but not cling and not billow out. Look, with movement clothes will untuck, wrinkle, and bunch.AND THAT\u2019S OKAY! Don\u2019t shrink wrap yourself. But look for trim fit clothes that fit and feel great, and strongly considerdeveloping a relationship with a tailor.#2. Carry a briefcase that walks the line between casual and dressed upGustin Made in the USA Deluxe Briefcase \u2013 $349Filson Made in the USA Original Brief in Cinder Gray \u2013$199($300ish)Boarding Pass NYC Flight Brief \u2013 $215WP Standard Zip Top Briefcase \u2013 $319You want a work bag that hits the middle ground. Somewhere between a casual, frumpy messenger bag, and an overly starchy hard sided attache. Look for something made from leather or canvas, with a bit of structure but not razor edged. You want to be taken seriously. You don\u2019t want to look like the guy delivering lunch from an electric scooter. Even if you are the guy who often delivers lunch\u2026 maybe from an electric scooter. Because, c\u2019mon. Everyone loves lunch.#3. Tweak the \u201cusual\u201d khaki/blue/brown business casual color schemeOutfit 1: casual layers, nothing over $100Outfit 2: Working from Home, Smart Casual Enclothed CognitionOutfit 3: Warm Weather Smart CasualOutfit 4: Fall Business casual, blues and graysEveryone wears khakis, blue and/or white button ups, and brown shoes. Mix that up! Instead of khaki chinos, go with green, deep brown, olive, or gray. Especially gray. WEAR MORE GRAY. Bounce contrast around, like instead of a lighter shirt, go withsomething more saturatedunder a lighter sweater or sportcoat. Or, go with a brightened up version of the standard office wear (try an aqua OCBD). Brighten up your footwear with lighter shades of cognac, or tan suede. You\u2019re not wearing purple pants with black \u201cgoing out\u201d club shirts (don\u2019t wear those\u2026 ever). Just take the norm, and tweak it a bit.#4.

Try something different. Go for suede! Or monk straps! Or a contemporary sneaker-chukka hybrid! You\u2019ve got options.#5.

If wearing something more modern/unexpected is too risky? Wear a brogue. It\u2019s the original flashy (but not too flashy) footwear.#6.

Keep it soft in terms of construction and breathable in terms of fabric (wool or lightweight cotton) and you can wear these with everything from a dress shirt to a casual button downto over a t-shirt.

Invest in and wear only the best, most comfortable underwear and socks \u2013Trash the stuff you hate and instead buy a bunch of breathable, wicking socks and underwear. That stuff isthe Offensive Lineof your wardrobe. The flashy \u201cskill positions\u201d (shoes, accessories, watches, suits, shirts, etc.) are worthless if you\u2019re not winning in the \u201ctrenches.\u201d Suggestions:Ex-Officio,UNIQLO Airism,Taylor Stitch Merino Socks,Allen Edmonds Merino Cool Socks.#3. Tuck-in button up shirts more \u2013Ever since the introduction of the \u201cuntucked\u201d fit, we grown-up guys have been encouraged to walk around looking like kindergartners on school picture day. Okay, it\u2019s far from that bad. It\u2019s not even bad. Who doesn\u2019t like an untucked-fit shirt? But tucking your shirt in makes you look put together, especially when it\u2019s layered under a suit, sportcoat, blazer, cardigan, etc.#4. Stop buying stuff you KNOW doesn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d for you.\u2013 Maybe it\u2019s gingham button downs. Or a certain wash of jeans. Or brown cords. Whatever. We all do this. We KNOW a certain color, style, fit, or brand doesn\u2019t work for us. Yet we still for some reason buy new versions thinking \u201cthis time it\u2019ll be different.\u201d It won\u2019t be.#5. Stop visiting style websites/unsubscribe from mailing lists that make you feel bad \u2013Unsubscribe. Delete the app. Block the site on your browser. This ESPECIALLY goes for sites and boards that always leave you feeling angry/sad/frustrated. This goes for Dappered too. If you\u2019re coming back out of pure habit and aren\u2019t actually enjoying it/getting USE out of what we\u2019re publishing? We hate to see you go, but I\u2019ll personally love it if you do and it makes you happier.#6. Go to bed earlier.\u2013 They call itbeautyhandsome sleep for a reason. Staying up until the wee hours watching YouTube and drinking flavored whiskey is taking years off your life and putting them on your face. Been there. I speak from experience when I say you\u2019re not missing much.#7. Wear more of what you want to WANT to wear\u2013 Practice doesn\u2019t make perfect. Practice makes comfortable. Want to want to wear suits more? Or ties? Or pants that don\u2019t have an elastic waist? Force yourself to wear it. After a week or so you\u2019ll feel a shift, it\u2019ll become old hat, and you\u2019ll feel (and look) great because of it.#8. Wear black shoes more\u2013 Boots with a bomber and jeans. Oxfords with a charcoal (or navy!) suit. Brown gets all the love. Someone shouldn\u2019t have to pass for you to wear your black shoes.#9. Stop using social media as a standard for looks/fit/etc.\u2013 It\u2019s not reality. It\u2019ll mess with your head, specifically what looks \u201cgood\u201d and what doesn\u2019t. The more a lie (or fantasy) is repeated,the more we tend to believe it, even if we KNOW it\u2019s nonsense. \u201cI\u2019m so f-in\u2019 sick and tired of the Photoshop\u201d \u2013Kendrick Lamar.#10. Wear something really nice, once a week. \u2013A really nice pair of shoes. A favorite sweater. Your sharpest (gasp) suit. You don\u2019t need a reason other than you earned it, you have it, and using it will make you less afraid of it/intimidated by it when you really DO need to wear it one day.Editor\u2019s Note: Resolutions aren\u2019t silly. They\u2019re only silly if you wait around until January 1st to get rolling on them. Start working on them now (this post was originally published in early December),and research has shown that you\u2019re much more likely to succeed. And don\u2019t think I\u2019m pointing fingers.

So\u2026different how? And how should you care for each?Let\u2019s break it down.Let\u2019s Fire it Up: What Is Roughout Leather?With each piece of full grain leather (leather that hasn\u2019t been split or thinned out in any way), there\u2019s typically a smooth, finished side, also called thegrain; this part was the animal\u2019s epidermis, the outer layer of skin.When you flip that leather over, you\u2019ll see a rough, hairy texture (referred to as thenap). This was the part of the animal\u2019s hide that connected to muscles and subcutaneous fat, known as the hypodermis; along with the dermis (the soft middle layer), this makes up thecorium. When the leather is flipped over to expose this corium on footwear (or any other leather product), this is most commonly referred to asroughout leather, or sometimesreverse leatherorfleshout leather.Cross section of animal hide.SourceOkay, So What\u2019s The Appeal of Roughout?Roughout leather is utilized not because it\u2019s somehow stronger or more water resistant than the grain side. Instead, the advantage of roughout is that it has a fairly static appearance, and doesn\u2019t show wear quite as easily as smooth leather. Also it, uh, just looks cool.White\u2019s 350 Cruisers in Seidel Distress RoughoutHow Do I Take Care of Roughout Leather?Because roughout maintains its appearance quite well, there is honestly so much less need for routine care than with smooth/grain-side leathers. You can use something like astiff bristle brushto scrape and scrub roughout leather to even out the look of the nap, or remove bits of dirt and dust if needed. The great thing about roughout is that it can go a lot longer (like, areallylong time) before it needsanysort of conditioning. Roughout is a fantastic choice of leather for footwear like work boots, where a neglected appearance doesn\u2019t matter as much (or is often even held as a point of pride).SB Foot Hawthorne Muleskinner Roughout on Red Wing Iron Rangers, worn quite hard for about four yearsSo What\u2019s Suede, Then? How\u2019s it Different?We\u2019ve explained how roughout is simply the underside of a piece of leather, the corium that exists below the grain. When you alter that corium, either by buffing it or by splitting it away from the grain, you getsuede. Suede is desirable for being a leather that also has a fuzzy nap, but with a more uniform appearance, and generally much shorter. This neater look makes it more desirable for a casual or semi-casual style of footwear or clothing.Alright Then Are There Different Kinds of Suede? Whadaya Got??There are a couple different kinds of suedes.Split suedeis one that most people are likely familiar with. This is where the corium has been separated from the grain completely, creating a leather that is thin and semi-permeable. (Often, hides are split by tanneries to create multiple sides of leather; one or two split suede sides, along with a top grain leather side.)Viberg Service Boot in Sweet Potato Veg SuedeWhile split suede is the industry standard, there\u2019s also a high-end version with superior tensile strength and water resistance. Withfull grain suede(orfull reverse suede),the corium is sanded or buffed slightly to achieve an even nap, and the grain layer is kept intact. It\u2019s similar to roughout leather, but with an even nap and slightly less thickness. The best-known full grain suede isC.F. Stead\u2019s Janus calf suede.How Do I Take Care of My Suede?So here\u2019s the thing about suede: you CAN baby it\u2014by keeping it from getting too much dirt and grime on it. Or you can just let it ride totally unchecked, which can end up looking pretty darn cool especially if you commit to not really caring about what happens to it\u2014with that \u201cdamn, dirty suede is cool\u201d effect heightened on a lighter colored suede, like snuff or even light tan/white.Alden Roy boots in CF Stead Snuff Suede. Three years wear, basically zero care.Here\u2019s another thing about suede: most suede, while not waterproof, is a lot more waterresistantthan plenty of people believe. More importantly, getting your suede rained on is almost definitely NOT going to ruin it (although that Seinfeld episode was quite good). Even a soaked suede pair of shoes or boots, properly dried out, will likely be more than fine.One thing that will do some damage to suede is anything that\u2019s especially oily or greasy\u2014we wouldn\u2019t recommend, say, rubbing a bunch of mayonnaise on your suede boots. But that\u2019s true of plenty of leathers. The upside on suede vs smooth/grain-side leathers is that you can use a suede spray likeSaphir Super Invulnerto keep that oily stuff at least somewhat at bay\u2014you just need to wipe it quick and cross your fingers.Beyond that, the same basic care routine applies for suede as well as roughout. Using astiff bristle suede brushcan clean out dirt and even out the nap. For especially grungy-looking suedes, you can also use more intensive products like suede shampoo, although again, it\u2019s not really going to remove truly oily spots.How Do I Make Suede or Roughout More Water Resistant?You can increase the water resistance of suede or roughout by applying something like the aforementionedwaterproofing sprayor a wax. This is something that the wearer can put on themselves, or oftentimes tanneries will give their leathers a finish of visible wax, or invisible waterproofing. Suede with a wax coat is simply referred to aswaxed suede, whereas waxed roughout is often calledwaxed flesh.Unmarked Durango Ranch Boot in Mosto Waxed SuedeWesco Engineer in Redwood Waxed FleshThere you go\u2014all the basics you need to know about roughout and suede!Previous ArticleWhat\u2019s a Cuban Heel?

It would probably be faster to list the bootmakers thatdon\u2019tuse Horween than the ones that do.Horween also specializes in a few processes that\u2014if you look at the tanning industry as a whole\u2014are fairly uncommon, including combination tanning (where hides receivebothchrome based and vegetable based tanning agents) and hot stuffing (which inundates the hide with heated fats and waxes to make it softer, richer, and easier to care for).If you want to see those processes in the flesh (decent pun??), we still have limited tickets for an exclusive guided Horween tannery tour atour Boot Camp mega-expo this November in Chicago.With that in mind we sat down with Nick Horween, the tannery\u2019s Vice President, and Phil Kalas, who works with Horween leather every day atAshland Leather Company(both also host the fantasticFull Grain Podcast!), to find out everything you need to know about Horween\u2019s leathers, starting with the most famous of them all\u2026Many of the photos here were taken from the exceptionalPatina Project app\u2014which also powers our Stitchdown Patina Thunderdome boot-aging contest with over $45,000 in prizes.Thunderdome FIVE tarts Oct 1 2025, more details here!Shell CordovanTannage:Vegetable tannedFinish:Hot stuffed, glazedWhat to Know:Shiny, stiff, expensive, and largely indestrucible; tends to \u201croll\u201d instead of creasing at flex pointsHorween has been tanning shell cordovan since before you were born (unless you were born in 1904), and shell\u2019s very much the original Horween product\u2014for its first few years the tannery didn\u2019t make anything else. It\u2019s dense, resistant to abrasion, and not very stretchy, all of which made it the leather of choice for\u2026 razor strops. Eventually the modern safety razor would make straight razors (and their strops) a rarity, but before that happened 20th century shoe-powerhouse Florsheim, also headquartered in Chicago, found that those very same properties made for excellent and hardy dress shoes, and a very good thing was born.Shell cordovan is an equine (horse) leather, technically a \u201csubcutaneous membrane\u201d\u2014a fibre structure beneath the skin\u2014that\u2019s 8 to 10 times denser than a more typical bovine hide. That density makes it slow and difficult to tan: cordovan spends almost two months in \u201cthe pits\u201d soaking up the vegetable tannins that turn the unpreserved hides into durable leather. The \u201cshells\u201d are only around 1.5-2 square feet, and occur at random depths within the hide, varying in size, thickness, and density. All of those factors come together to make shell cordovan very expensive\u2014not just to tan, but also to work with.Density also varies within individual shells, making them difficult to cut and skive\u2014tools catch if they suddenly hit a dense spot, or skip if they hit a loose one. On shoes, the fact that cordovan dosen\u2019t like to stretch makes it particularly difficult to last the uppers.So why do so many people find it worth the trouble? Shell takes on an incredible sheen both new and with a bit of care work, and has a depth of color you\u2019d be hard pressed to find anywhere else. It\u2019s also resistant to cuts and abrasion (sometimes for decades) and durablybeautiful: no other leather burnishes and patinas quite like it. In \u201cregular\u201d leather there\u2019s a layer of grain on one face, with layers of looser fibers beneath it. When repeatedly flexed, the grain delaminates from the fibers below. Delamination produces \u201cbreak\u201d, the wrinkling and creasing you find on leather shoes where the vamp flexes. With no grain, cordovan doesn\u2019t break, instead forming smooth rolls. Aesthetically this is pretty subjective\u2014people tend to love it or less-love it\u2014but we fall solidly into the love camp.On footwear, shell cordovan is shiny and easy to maintain; it lasts basically forever and keeps getting better the whole time. It also tends to be fairly stiff. Lighter colors can be prone to water spotting, and though it wont crease it will, as mentioned, form rolls, sometimes quite strong ones. Of course, the limited supply of responsibly sourced hides and the lengthy tanning process means shell cordovan\u2019s biggest downside is its price. We\u2019ve already written an even deeper guide to how shell is made and how it ages, which you can check outhere.Workshoe ButtTannage:Vegetable tannedorcombination tannedFinish:Hot stuffed, sometimes polishedWhat to Know:Dense and hardy, burnishes wellShell cordovan is a membrane beneath the surface of the skin, but the layers above it don\u2019t just get shy and run off; you have to shave them away, and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ve got Workshoe Butt: full thickness horsebutts with the shell still inside.Workshoe Butt, like cordovan, is a cut of hide and not a tannage, so in theory you could make Waxed Flesh Workshoe Butts, Chromepak Workshoe Butts, or anything else you dream up. Horween generally uses a modified version of the Chromexcel tannage. The hides spend their first month alongside shell cordovan in the tanning pits, and then get pulled out before being retanned and finished like Chromexcel (more on that below), except chromium salts are added to the retan in order to make the leather stronger and more heat resistant. That\u2019s the opposite of most combination tanned leathers, which get chrome salts first and vegetable tannins during the retan.The final product is generally somewhere between six and eight square feet, with about half of that area containing of two shells beneath the surface. Historically the idea has been that if you\u2019re clicking a boot it won\u2019tallinclude shell, but the person at the clicking table can be strategic about placing it where it counts\u2014usually the vamp\u2014for some extra durability. Workshoe Butt is dense and hardy, and it takes burnishing really well, even on the non-shell sections. Phil says he\u2019s clicked some shell-less wallets with it and you\u2019d be hard pressed to tell; it\u2019s a leather that seems determined to get smooth and compact as it wears.There are two versions: a regular version which is polished to even out the grain and remove cosmetic imperfections, producing a smoother, shiner, pull-up leather; and a crust version that\u2019s more matte, more natural, and more likely to have scars and markings. The best comparison here is probably sanding wood.\u2014the grain isn\u2019tgone, you\u2019re just seeing a different cross section of it.The magic of this stuff is undersold by its initial appearance\u2014that\u2019s not to say it looks bad new, but it\u2019s nothing compared to what it looks like after a few months (or years) of hard wear.Chromexcel (and Its Many Variants)Tannage:Combination tannedFinish:Hot stuffed, slightly corrected grainWhat to Know:Soft, flexible, practically self-conditioningAs we\u2019ve already seen, Chromexcel can refer to a number of leathers, but they all have a couple of things in common. Chromexcel is a tannage, and specifically combination tannage, meaning that the leather is first tanned in drums using chromium salts and then retanned using vegetable tannins. Chrome lends high tensile strength and heat resistance, while veg adds burnishability, better patina potential, and subjectively, a better feel. The leathers in the Chromexcel family are hot stuffed with different blends of fats and receive a variety of finishes, but the unofficial line where the apple has fallen too far from the tree is when you modify with the specific blend of tanning and retanning compounds\u2014change that blend and you no longer have Chromexcel.We\u2019re going to speedrun the family tree to give you an overview of some of the most notable variants.Classic/Marine Field Shoe:This is almost always what people are talking about when they talk about Chromexcel, and Horween sells it as simply \u201cChromexcel\u201d. No prefix, no modifier. It\u2019s a flexible and malleable steer hide hot stuffed with a ton of waxes and oils which is soft but durable and tends to produce comfortable footwear. In grain-out Chromexcel, a little buffing is all it takes to remove lighter scuffs and scratches. One of the most ubiquitous leathers in the industry, it sits right at the balance point between \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cdress\u201d leathers. Generally you\u2019ll find it on rugged-leaning boots designed more for everyday wear than the job site, though Nicks and White\u2019s make very capable work boots out of the stuff. Natural Chromexcel in particular can develop somepretty striking patina. Roughout Chromexcel specifically finished for the reverse side is often referred to as \u201cMarine Field Shoe\u201d.Wooly:Wooly Chromexcel uses extra lanolin during the hot stuffing process. Lanolin, otherwise known as wool fat, is a grease that\u2019s found naturally in wool and removed during preparation for spinning and weaving. The effect is a leather that\u2019s shinier, almost to the point of being self-polishing, and also darker in color than other variants. It\u2019s also unbuffed. (Nick Horween: \u201cIt\u2019s not like the lanolin you\u2019re used to seeing\u2026 we buy the lanolin that\u2019s stuck to the bottom of the drum when they\u2019re done cooking it. The stuff that looks like tar is the stuff that\u2019s good for leather.)Natural M\u2019s:Natural M\u2019s is a variant of a variant. It\u2019s a version ofmechanicalchromexcel, an extremely strong and dense tannage Horween used to produce for use in gaskets on engines and other machinery. Like workshoe butts, it\u2019s first chrome-tanned, and then sent to the pits. Natural M\u2019s is often run on bison to accentuate the already intense grain. It\u2019s tougher than classic Chromexcel and not quite as soft or stretchy.Beaufort:Chromexcel is usually hot stuffed with enough oils and waxes that it\u2019s almost impossible to glue, making it difficult to use on cemented shoes and other glued products. Beaufort\u2019s stuffing blend isn\u2019t as rich, making it possible (though not easy) to glue. If you see Chromexcel used on cemented sneaker or dress shoe, it may be Beaufort.Buccaneer/Navigator:These two leatherstechnicallycross the line above in that the they have a modified retanning blend that differs from classic Chromexcel. But we\u2019re including them because they\u2019re essentially (in Nick\u2019s words) waterproof Chromexcel. Of course \u201cwaterproof\u201d leather can mean a lot of different things, but you can basically trust that if you\u2019re wearing well-made shoes in Buccaneer you\u2019ll be able to splash through some water with dry feet and intact boots. Scuba dive at your own risk.Waxed FleshTannage:Combination tannedFinish:Hot stuffed; ironed, dyed, and waxed on the flesh sideWhat to Know:Stiff hand; nap will stand up over time, but can be re-waxedHere\u2019s where the lines geteven blurrier: waxed flesh is certainly a Chromexcel variant. It\u2019s tanned and finished almost exactly the same way as classic Chromexcel, except all of the finishing that\u2019s normally done to the grain is done to the flesh side of the leather (including the wax finish, hencewaxed flesh). That said, Waxed Flesh is common enough and different enoughon bootsthat we wanted to break it out on its own.Visually the cool thing about waxed flesh is that as it wears, the nap \u2014which has been ironed smooth, dyed, and waxed\u2014begins to stand up, creating two-toned effect, changing the texture, and showing off the wear. Applying a coat of wax lays it back down again should you ever want to.Functionally this makes the leather extremely hard wearing, because wear that would cut or scratch a grain leather just pushes the nap around, and you can effectively wax away most minor damage. One side effect of finishing the flesh is that Waxed Flesh is quite stiff, especially at first.When leather bends\u2014especially thick leather\u2014the side of the hide \u201cinside\u201d the turn is compressed and the side \u201coutside\u201d the turn is stretched. Imagine a marching band going around a corner: the people on the inside of the curve travel a much shorter distance that the people on the outside of the curve, so the people on the inside have to slow down and bunch together, and the people on the outside have to speed up and spread out, or everybody looses their spacing and crashes into each other.On grain-side boots, the looser nap fibers can pull apart and stretch out, but finishing them locks them together, preventing this from happening. Waxed Flesh is often used unlined, because the grain of the leather is on the inside of the boot anyways. Because of this, it\u2019s often used in heavier weights.Some finished-flesh leathers start to expose their nap very quickly with wear\u2014Horween\u2019s waxed flesh tends to take a bit of work, and be just a bit tougher to break in. One of the unique things about it is just how much control you have over the patina process. In medium and dark colors periodic rewaxing can keep the uppers somewhat close to new (you\u2019re never going to be able to replicate at home what tannery equipment can do), give or take some darkening and shine on high wear areas. If you want high contrast and fuzzy, just leave them alone. As with other roughouts or suedes, you also don\u2019t need to worry about grain break.CavalierTannage:Combination tannedFinish:Lightly hot stuffed, slightly corrected grain, bright dye colorsWhat to Know:Shiny and stiffCavalier is also in the Chromexcel-verse, but it uses its own retanning blend and gets a different mix of oils. It\u2019s designed to be really good at one thing: taking bright colors. Classic Chromexcel comes in pretty much any color that\u2019s brown, from brown to very light brown (natural) and even red-brown (Color 8). We\u2019re pretty sure under a spectrometer black Chromexcel would show up as anextremelydark brown. But the retanning and hot-stuffing process puts too many tannins and fats into the leather for bright colors to render clearly.Cavalier uses a lighter \u201cblond\u201d retannage and gets less grease, allowing it to take bright colors like the evocatively named \u2018London Bus Red\u201d. If you\u2019re seeing it on a piece of footwear, it\u2019s almost always because the maker wanted didn\u2019t want to be restricted to earth tones.PredatorTannage:Combination tannedFinish:Heavily waxedWhat to Know:Very durable; burnishes to a shine with hard use.With only fifteen years under its belt, Predator is a \u201cnew\u201d tannage in the world of Horween, and it\u2019s sort of Horween\u2019s take on what\u2019s sometimes called a \u201ccrazy horse\u201d leather. The bottom line though: this stuffburnisheslike crazy.It\u2019s a really rich and waxy finish with a lot of highs and lows in terms of color, and it also has a more matte finish than classic Chromexcel. Both of these traits make Predator a more ruggedlookingleather. The retannage uses more modern synthetic resins in addition to mimosa bark to produce a more consistent and stronger leather than a more traditional combination tannage, backing up the tough look, but if you put a pair of Predator boots on the burnishing wheel you can allegedly get a very shiny, almost dressy look\u2014that certainly maps onto what we\u2019ve seen, which is some really striking shine and darkening on dome pairs (mostlyNicks Boots) in Predator.What\u2019s happening is that on a micro scale, the peaks and valleys in the surface of the leather are getting filled in by wax to form a new, smooth surface, which means that all of the light that lands on the boots gets reflected back at the same angle instead of being scattered by the valleys and peaks. It\u2019s the same process that happens if you polish your shoes, but the amount and type of surface wax in Predator speeds up the process and allows it to happen naturally without much help.Predator tends to show up on work boots and rugged everyday boots, and it\u2019s probably best to think of it as a performance oriented tannage that\u2019salsodesigned with an eye to look and patina. If you need cool boots to really beat up it\u2019s a pretty strong choice.ChromepakTannage:Chrome tannedFinish:Heavily hot stuffedWhat to Know:Can develop less patina than other leathers; fairly water resistantChromepak is the first straight-chrome tannage we\u2019ve talked about so far, meaning there are no vegetable tannins involved in the process at all: chrome base tannage, chrome retannage. The stuffing blend is heavier on both oils and waxes, and it\u2019s pasted\u2014literally glued to a pane of glass\u2014so it doesn\u2019t shrink as it dries, meaning there\u2019s a lot less stretch. It\u2019s soft, water resistant, and extremely strong. It won\u2019t patina quite like a veg or combination tanned leather does (though it will still age and express wear plenty well), but it\u2019s more water resistant and can take more abuse that most other leathers.What this comes down to can be summed up pretty succinctly: \u201cYou can do a lot of bad things to it and it doesn\u2019t really care\u201d. You might also be drawn to the matte finish or the consistent way it ages if you\u2019re lukewarm on intense patina.Chamois and Snuffed SuedeTannage:Combination tannedFinish:Sanded, oiled if chamoisWhat to Know:Fine surface nap; less creasing due to the sanded finish.Horween carries out a lot of different processes and tans a lot of different leathers, far more than most tanning operations. But one thing it doesn\u2019t do is true suede, meaning a \u201csplit\u201d leather that doesn\u2019t include the grain. The closest it gets is Snuffed Suede, a nubuck style corrected leather where the surface is sanded down enough to create some nap, but the grain isn\u2019t completely gone.It\u2019s chrome tanned, veg-retanned, and fat liquored with a blend of oils and waxes that lend themselves to burnishing, and which are also light enough that Horween can produce snuffed suede in a range of colors from bone to jet black, including bright lavenders, yellows, and baby blues. Snuffed Suede doesn\u2019t have the same nap or \u201cfuzziness\u201d as the suedes you\u2019re used to\u2014it has a very fine, velvety texture and from a distance might be mistaken for a matte grain leather. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that we\u2019re not talking about \u201csnuff suede\u201d either, which is the snuffcolorof C.F. Stead\u2019s Janus Calf Suede.Chamois (technically pronounced SHAM-ee, although we can be rightly be accused of calling it SHAM-wah over the years) is Snuffed Suede that\u2019s been treated with an oil finish on both sides. As a result of the dark oils, the color range goes from expansive to fairly narrow, but it more than makes up for it in texture and finish. With use and burnishing it can take on a look similar to waxed flesh, with the nap laid down and darkened to a shine.It was popularized (at least recently) by Alden, as was reverse Chamois. As Nick heard it, the story goes like this: an Alden retailer ordered a sample in Chamois, and whoever happened to be on the production line at the time clicked it backwards and assembled the upper with the flesh side out. They were about ready to get fired, but when they asked someone to take a look at the shoes they looked good enough that Alden started running reverse chamois, now more common than the smooth version.Essex and DublinTannage:Vegetable tannedFinish:Hot stuffed, ironed, oiled (Essex)orwaxed (Dublin)What to Know:Supple compared to other veg-tans; can crease more wildly than other Horween leathersEssex and Dublin are, on the footwear front, Horween\u2019s veg-tanned bovine leathers of note. Essex uses a slightly tweaked version of the tannage developed for shell, with a similar blend of fat liquors, or at least the current version does. The original was a little more intense.Here\u2019s how Phil tells the story:\u201cI came in to work one day. Skip Horween had his mad scientist hat on\u2014he was all wide eyed\u2014and said \u201cyou have to come look at this\u201d. He had the wild idea to take a steerhide and put it alongside cordovan in the pits. And it was awesome, like, five times the mass of a normal hide\u2026\u201d Too heavy and dense, as it turned out, for just about any application.That \u201coriginal Essex\u201d was tweaked until it became usable, and the current version of the tannage has changed a lot. In fact, it\u2019s notable for being more supple and less stiff than many of the full veg-leathers that are out there. It\u2019s ironed during the finishing process, resulting in a final product with a lot of shine. If that final product gets a oil finish, it\u2019s Essex, and if it gets a wax finish, it\u2019s Dublin.The waxed finish gives Dublin some extra density and means you can remove scuffs and scratches by heating up the wax and melting it back into place. Essex and Dublin produce patina ranging from a soft glow crosshatched with mild creasing to a pretty serious transformation more typical of lighter shades. Its creases and hairline folds are more dramatic than the grain break on most leathers. It\u2019s part of the look, but definitely something to keep in mind, whether you\u2019re chasing it or trying to steer clear.Going DeeperIf you want to get a better feel for any of the leathers listed here, it\u2019s worth taking a look atPatina Project app, which documents the way hundreds of different leathers wear and age, and also gives you a better sense of just how much one leather can vary when made into different boots or subject to different lifestyles.At the end of the dayallof the leathers we\u2019re talking about here are really very excellent for footwear; they\u2019ll handle the wear most people put them through without issue. The joy is in the tactile details\u2014the feel, the look, and yeah, the smell\u2014because Horween goes to pretty extreme lengths to make leathers that aren\u2019tjustmechanically sufficient, but also quite pleasant to experience.As we found out talking Nick and Phil, a whole lot of questions at Horween are answered with \u201cthey tried it a century ago and we do it the way that turned out better\u201d. The best way to experience the result is to pick one and wear it really hard.Previous ArticleShoes \u2018n\u2019 Boots of the Week: Nicks Wellingtons, Alden Service Shoes, Women\u2019s Tricker\u2019s at DRNext ArticleShoes \u2018n\u2019 Boots of the Week: Studded Engineers from Brogue, Unlined Grant Stone Loafers, Endless New ParkhurstRelated PostsHow Seidel 1964 Leather AgesJosh BornsteinSeptember 19, 2023How Horween Shell Cordovan Is Made, And How It AgesJosh BornsteinSeptember 12, 2023Red Wing\u2019s Oro Leathers: The History of The Irish Setter, How The Iconic Moc Toes\u2019 Leathers Have Evolved, and How They AgeJosh BornsteinAugust 30, 2022How Teacore Leather AgesJosh BornsteinAugust 23, 2022How C.F.

      "body": "How Teacore Leather AgesJosh BornsteinAugust 23, 2022So far in ourHow Leathers Ageseries, we\u2019ve covered some specific leathers from specific tanneries. This time around, we\u2019re gonna take a step back and look at a bunch of different leathers, from various tanners, that all share a common trait: an outer layer that slowly fades or chips away to reveal a rich inner layer of brown.That\u2019s right, we\u2019re talking about one of the most appealing, patina-worthy kinds of leathers out there: teacore.What Is Teacore Leather?We\u2019ll say it again because the question above demands it: teacore leather is essentially any leather that shows a brown undertone over time as the dyes or pigments on the surface wear off. Teacore is most commonly associated with having a black exterior, but as long as the inner layer shows a brown color, any color of leather could be considered teacore. Its name is derived from the brown inner layer\u2019s resemblance to a strong cup of tea. (Some makers, likeSagara, play off this idea by offering \u201cmatchacore\u201d leather\u2014overdyed leather with a green interior.)Teacore leathers are most commonly made using veg tan leathers, though you can also encounter chrome-tanned teacore leathers. The bark tannins used in veg tanning will typically imbue the leather with a shade of brown, making it more conducive to use for a teacore effect. Chrome tanned leather, on the other hand, typically has a grayish-blue tint, and will need to be struck through with brown dye before getting an outer coat to achieve the teacore look.MORE:HOW HORWEEN NATURAL CHROMEXCEL AGESHOW MARYAM TOSCANELLO HORSEBUTT AGESHOW C.F. STEAD WAXY COMMANDER LEATHER AGESThe reasons for making and utilizing teacore leather are twofold. First off, the teacore effect just looks incredible to many people, and is a sign that the article of footwear (or clothing) the leather is a part of is well-worn and well-loved. Furthermore, teacore leather harkens back to an era where clothes like leather jackets were commonly made to last with strong, durable materials (i.e. veg tan leather) and usually pigmented or otherwise not dyed through completely.To delve more into the topic of teacore, we recommend checking out Heddels\u2019teacore leather explainer.Pre-Register for the 2022-2023 Patina Thunderdome Today\u2014You Might Win a Trip to Japan! Really!!How Shinki Black Latigo Horsehide AgesThe firstStitchdown Patina Thunderdomepair that we\u2019ll showcase here is aVibergService Boot made with a black latigo horsehide from Japanese tanner Shinki Hikaku. For basically any teacore leather, a great way to get a preview of what the inner layer will look like is to look at the raw edges on the leather\u2014note the edge of the heel counter here.At the end of the Dome, these boots showed some pretty classic teacore wear, albeit with a fairly light inner layer (tea with milk, basically).How SB Foot Black Prairie AgesRed Wing Heritagealmost exclusively features leather from Red Wing\u2019s own tannery, SB Foot, and these Blacksmiths are no exception. Black Prairie was designed with teacore patina in mind.After seven months, not only is there obvious wear on the toes and parts of the heel, but you can see that some of the top coat came off the tongues from where the laces were rubbing.How Black Overdyed Cloe Superlux Horsebutt AgesA slightly different way of achieving a teacore look is through overdyeing, where a leatherworker takes a finished side of leather and adds another layer of dye or pigment to the surface. The Cloe horsebutt on theseSagaraValiants got a nice coat of black dye, but you can see some brown poking through where the leather was stretched in the lasting process.The transformation is dramatic\u2014by the end of the contest, there\u2019s more brown than black remaining.How Horween Black Shell Cordovan AgesBlack shell is perhaps not the most \u201ctraditional\u201d kind of teacore\u2026\u2026but you can\u2019t argue with the results on these Viberg Service Boots, achieved through heavy wear as well as sunfading.In Conclusion\u2026Teacore leather has the potential to be an absolute patina monster, especially for boot owners who often find themselves kicking around all kinds of things, or are otherwise quite active. It ages magnificently, and honestly, in a niche that\u2019s often full of brown and red leathers, it\u2019s a great excuse to own at least one black pair of boots.Previous ArticleViberg\u2019s Janus Suede-Heavy Fall/Winter 2022 Collection Apparently Grew Out of a RainforestNext ArticleShoes \u2018n\u2019 Boots of the Week: Baker\u2019s Boots Jams With Jamvaida, Black Bear\u2019s Wicked Wescos, and MoreRelated Posts12 Essential Horween Footwear Leathers: How They\u2019re Made, and How They AgeZaid HintzmanJuly 25, 2025How Seidel 1964 Leather AgesJosh BornsteinSeptember 19, 2023How Horween Shell Cordovan Is Made, And How It AgesJosh BornsteinSeptember 12, 2023Grant Stone Brass Boot Review\u2014and a Deep Dive into The Wonders of Kudu LeatherJosh BornsteinNovember 8, 2022Red Wing\u2019s Oro Leathers: The History of The Irish Setter, How The Iconic Moc Toes\u2019 Leathers Have Evolved, and How They AgeJosh BornsteinAugust 30, 2022How C.F.

      "body": "How Seidel 1964 Leather AgesJosh BornsteinSeptember 19, 2023Nicks Bootshas seen an incredible number of changes in the past few years. Under the leadership of theMowe family, the company has grown significantly as Nicks has doubled (and then tripled) the number of differentbootsthey offer, while also branching out into variousleather goodsandaccessories. Nicks has also dabbled in a wide variety of leathers, including some that can only be found at this Spokane, WA-based bootmaker.One of those exclusives is their 1964 Leather, a product developed in collaboration with Milwaukee, WI tannerySeidel. This oily work leather has a thickness and density which belies its surprising ability to break in and soften up without too much effort. In our continuingHow Leathers Ageseries, we\u2019ll explain 1964\u2019s unique characteristics and take a look at how it can patina.What Is 1964 Leather?1964 takes its name from the year Nicks Boots was founded. The inspiration for this chrome-tanned steerhide leather came in the form of an old pair of Nicks that walked into their shop one day. They belonged to a former Nicks employee who had gotten the boots sometime around the late 1970s/early 1980s. The leather on these boots was quite thick, but with a surprisingly soft suppleness. Without being certain of what the specific tannage was, the folks at Nicks were determined to try and recreate the look and feel of this relatively ancient leather.Nicks tappedSeidel Tanningto produce a leather that would replicate the old leather\u2019s characteristics. The process took two years and several iterations before 1964 Leather was finally unveiled in 2021. Originally available in brown, Nicks subsequently added several other colors to their lineup, including black, walnut, chocolate, and tan.The 1964 Leather is described as Nicks\u2019s \u201cEasy Break-In\u201d work leather, at least in comparison to the Seidel work leather they\u2019ve been using for decades (now called \u201cMax Support\u201d by Nicks). At first blush, this leather will seem anything but easy to break in\u2014it starts out with an intimidatingly dense, rigid temper. However, after just a few wears, the leather becomes significantly more pliable in a way that feels counterintuitive to how friggin\u2019 thick it all is (7 to 8 ounces, or about 3 millimeters). This is thanks to the heavy infusion of oils Seidel adds through their hot-stuffing process, which yields a leather that is less dry and stiff in comparison to the Max Support leather.How 1964 Brown AgesBrown was the first color introduced in the 1964 tannage, and it\u2019s seemingly the most popular offering in the leather. It\u2019s a nice medium-brown tone, a good all-rounder.Rustywrench67wore these Falcons in last year\u2019s first-everStitchdown Patina Work Thunderdome, where he placed second overall.Some really nice work on these. The gradient of colors between the top and bottom of the boots is quite stark.slow.smooth\u2019s BuilderPros were made with the flesh side of 1964 Brown, which looks significantly lighter than the grain side.He beat the absolute tar out of these boots. While a couple applications ofObenauf\u2019s LP(a heavy-duty conditioner recommended by Nicks) will cause the leather to darken like this, slow.smooth said his only care routine was regular brushing.How 1964 Walnut Ages1964 Walnut has more of a greyish brown look compared to 1964 Brown. These Overlanders worn byescapedTexanoffer a great example of the color.With good wear, 1964 Walnut\u2019s grain will take on a dark fudge hue.1964 Walnut Roughout has a similar shade of color to the grain side, as seen below onbrokeno\u2019s Roberts.Much like the grain side, the roughout will darken up significantly (at least in the areas that don\u2019t get covered in dirt and dust).How 1964 Tan Ages1964 Tan is arguably the most patina-ready leather in the 1964 family. These lace-to-toe boots worn byHomer346started out looking absolutely ghostly.At the end of the Dome, some permanent scuffs and stains prominently remained, while the overall leather got a distinct suntan.Hetpaul\u2019s BuilderPros were made with the roughout side of 1964 Tan, which has a slightly darker, more beige appearance compared to the grain side.While these boots didn\u2019t appear to visit any dirty jobsites, the leather nonetheless darkened a couple shades.Nicks 1964, In ConclusionThe 1964 tannage has some terrific patina potential. The lighter shades (Brown and Tan) definitely seem like the way to go if you\u2019re looking for a distinct evolution in appearance, but don\u2019t count out darker colors like Walnut to show some prominent wear. If you\u2019re in need of a sturdy work leather with plenty of character, 1964 leather is an excellent choice.Previous ArticleRose Anvil\u2019s FINAL Take on Alden Indys, Plus Behind The Scenes of the RA OperationNext ArticleShoes \u2018n\u2019 Boots of the Week: Ostmo x Iron Boots Type I, A New Nicks Hunting Line, and More!Related Posts12 Essential Horween Footwear Leathers: How They\u2019re Made, and How They AgeZaid HintzmanJuly 25, 2025How Horween Shell Cordovan Is Made, And How It AgesJosh BornsteinSeptember 12, 2023Red Wing\u2019s Oro Leathers: The History of The Irish Setter, How The Iconic Moc Toes\u2019 Leathers Have Evolved, and How They AgeJosh BornsteinAugust 30, 2022How Teacore Leather AgesJosh BornsteinAugust 23, 2022How C.F.

Stead\u2019s Waxy Commander.Not only doesWaxy Commanderoffer superior waterproof protection from the elements, but it also packs a serious patina punch as it wears in\u2014a handsomely rugged package. In our continuingHow Leathers Ageseries, today we\u2019re shining the spotlight on this brilliant waxed suede, along with some excellent worn examples of Waxy Commander from the Stitchdown Patina Thunderdome.C.F. Stead: A British Powerhouse For Over 120 YearsIt\u2019s worth knowing the company behind Waxy Commander, and C.F. Stead is one that you\u2019ve probably already heard of if you\u2019re into high-quality suedes, or less-common leathers like kudu and deer.The Charles F. Stead Tannery was established in the 1890s, and since 1904 it has been producing exceptional leathers in the Sheepscar Tannery in Leeds, England (the facility itself is nearly 200 years old!).Through the years,C.F. Stead has supplied many kinds of leather for the demands of different eras, from the rise in popularity of suede shoes, to the advent of the biker jacket, to the supplying of British troops\u2019 garments during World War II, and beyond.Waxy Commander came about in the 1990s, the result of a request from iconic English shoe brand Dr. Martens. They wanted a suede that would be rugged, hard-wearing, and waterproof. This leather checked all the boxes in such a way that C.F. Stead felt that name \u201cWaxy Commander\u201d was the most appropriate.Waxy Commander\u2019s unique tannage involves shrinking the hide to tighten its fiber structure (reducing the area of the hide by up to 25 percent). This strengthens the leather, making it more impermeable to the elements. In addition, the leather is heavily waxed during the tanning process, yielding a product that is not only waterproof but has a great depth of character. Like a grain leather with heavy pull-up, Waxy Commander handsomely reveals depth with every crease, and the top coat on this leather can scratch off a bit more easily than it does on waxed flesh, leaving it with a stubble-y texture.HOW HORWEEN NATURAL CHROMEXCEL AGESHOW MARYAM TOSCANELLO HORSEBUTT AGESHow Tobacco Waxy Commander AgesFrom day one of the Patina Thunderdome, the Tobacco Waxy Commander on theseGrant Stone Edward Bootsalready began to patina. The waxes have begun to disperse just from the owner trying these boots on to see if they\u2019d fit.What\u2019s crazy is that after just one month of wear, these things already look really well-worn.The level of creasing and rubbed-off wax at the end of the Dome is tremendous.How Wheatbuck Waxy Commander AgesTheseParkhurstRichmonds were recognized as the Exceptional Parkhurst Pair in theinaugural Patina Thunderdome. Like the previous example, this Wheatbuck Waxy Commander is easily showing every little scratch and scuff before it\u2019s been properly worn.Once again, with only a month of wear, the change becomes quite dramatic.To be honest, the difference between the first and seventh month of wear isn\u2019t that distinct, but that early patina was pretty damn good to begin with.How Earth Waxy Commander AgesDay one with theseGrant Stone Chelseasis nothing crazy\u2026\u2026but yet again, in just one month, they\u2019ve completely transformed.The Earth Waxy Commander lived up to its name. By the end of the contest, all the accumulated dirt and dust really made these look, well, earthy.In Conclusion\u2026That old saying comes to mind: \u201cthe candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long.\u201d Indeed, you can tell fairly quickly where Waxy Commander\u2019s patina journey is going to end up, and it can be difficult to push it much farther than how it looks after that first month of wear\u2014but the character and complexity of the patina from that first month alone makes Waxy Commander quite the intriguing leather.Do you think you can push Waxy Commander even further than what you\u2019ve seen here?Pre-register for the next Patina Thunderdomewith your own Waxy Commander pair!Previous ArticleFive Quick Questions For Kyle Baker, CBO (Chief Boot Officer) of Baker\u2019s BootsNext ArticleHow to Win the Stitchdown Patina ThunderdomeRelated Posts12 Essential Horween Footwear Leathers: How They\u2019re Made, and How They AgeZaid HintzmanJuly 25, 2025How Seidel 1964 Leather AgesJosh BornsteinSeptember 19, 2023How Horween Shell Cordovan Is Made, And How It AgesJosh BornsteinSeptember 12, 2023Grant Stone Brass Boot Review\u2014and a Deep Dive into The Wonders of Kudu LeatherJosh BornsteinNovember 8, 2022Red Wing\u2019s Oro Leathers: The History of The Irish Setter, How The Iconic Moc Toes\u2019 Leathers Have Evolved, and How They AgeJosh BornsteinAugust 30, 2022How Teacore Leather AgesJosh BornsteinAugust 23, 2022",

      "body": "Photos by @deshellvedge and @tichoblancoshoesShell Cordovan Care: Absolutely Everything You Need To KnowAndy Vaughn & @deshellvedgeOctober 9, 2020Shell cordovan, that most magical of leathers derived from a horse\u2019s hindquarters, is also one that stands to benefit most from regular care.Can you just let your shell breathe, take a beating, and patina away? Absolutely! And it can look great! Please send me pictures! But shell\u2019s resiliency, high shine potential, bounce-back-i-ness, and depth of color can all be leveraged or enhanced by a very simple routine care approach.So with that, here\u2019s everything you need to know about shell cordovan care. Enjoy.How often should I engage in shell cordovan care? What\u2019s the best approach?Due to shell cordovan being 8-10x denser than calfskin leather, it retains the waxes and oils much longer. Truly, the two best things you can do for your shell footwear, is to brush it regularly, and store it with shoe trees between wears.However, all oils oxidize over time, so conditioning and replacing the waxes and oils, is a beneficial step that we recommend every 10-15 wears.How much conditioner should I use? How much is too much? Is too little a thing?You don\u2019t want to have product left sitting on the surface of your footwear. Err on the side of too-little, rather than too-much. Too much product becomes sticky and attracts dust and dirt. Too little product and you just need to catch up with the next conditioning session.What about colored cream vs neutral cream? What are the plusses and minuses?Shell cordovan doesn\u2019t have pores that can accept the pigment in most colored creams, the same way calfskin or other smooth-out leathers can. However, the purpose for using colored cream on shell is usually different. You use colored cream on calfskin to replenish the color loss from scuff marks, or to brighten color loss from fading over time. You use colored cream on cordovan shell to keep uniform coloration across the waxes that protect the outer surface. And, scuffs, are dealt-with through heat and friction \u201crubbing out\u201d.Many shell cordovan consumers love the natural patina that develops from the migration of oils and UV fading that occurs over time. For that approach, a neutral cream offers the same protection and conditioning benefits of a colored cream, but without any additional pigmentation.Should I use colored polish on my shell?This is a personal preference. If you do use colored cream, it won\u2019t have any permanent or lasting stains \u2013 like dye \u2013 that you have to worry about. But, it will better retain its coloration across wears. If you use neutral, you won\u2019t suffer any ill effects, but will still see the natural patina developing.How do I mirror shine shell cordovan?Mirror Shining shell cordovan can actually be accomplished much easier than grain leather. Grain leather requires filling in the pores beforehand, whereas shell cordovan does not. Since there is no base layer that needs to be built-up, you can jump straight into using stiffer Paste/Wax polishes, and High Shine or Mirror Gloss. These stiff waxes will still need to adhere to the shell cordovan. So, apply them in very thin layers using your fingertips, or a thin cloth. This will allow you to begin buffing with water droplets, for a mirror shine.I recommend 1-2 thin layers of wax, before starting the buffing process. Then, lightly \u201cdab & swirl\u201d stiff waxes, buffing a single droplet of water across the surface, will bring out the highest reflective shine.Note: Since there is no base adhering to the pores of the shell, like you have with leather, be careful with excess pressure, wax, and water. As too much of any of these, will quickly clump or slough off the shine.Want to chat shoes and leather all day?

Learn more through here.What causes spotting? Is it water?Yes, water spotting is common with shell cordovan. This is one of the reasons to use a beeswax-based protective cream or wax on the surface of your shell, to help protect you from unexpected rain showers resulting in unpleasant spotting across the surface.Ok, so how do I get rid of it?If you do get caught in an unexpected downpour, don\u2019t fret, as a quick remedy can be achieved. After taking them off for the day, use a damp cloth for a quick wipedown. Some water spots become more difficult to remove if you don\u2019t address them quickly. Later, you can then brush them off, followed by a thin layer of protective cream polish, rubbed into the shell, and a thorough brushing. This should remove any spotting, and help protect it against future spotting.And can it be prevented ahead of time?Some shell will spot at the sight of rain, while others (even the same maker and tannery) will soak it up and keep clear of spots, like nothing happened. You can minimize the likelihood, but can never 100% prevent it. See above.Alright what\u2019s the deal with these deer bones? Do they actually do anything?Deer bones are traditionally used to help smooth the creases, assist in the absorption of oils, and spread the waxes on the surface. They have a similar effect to horse or boar\u2019s hair brushes, but with more direct pressure, that helps with pushing against the dense tissue of shell cordovan. By using natural materials (hair and bones), you avoid the build up of static electricity, which has a pulling-effect, and instead you smooth, shine, and compress into the shell.I\u2019ve heard that you can smooth out rolls with a metal spoon too, in lieu of a deer bone\u2026any truth to that?Yes, absolutely. It still offers the same pressure and smoothing effect. Only spoons don\u2019t come with embedded oils. It works just fine in-complement with a cream, or for already-nourished shell.How do I get rid of scratches and scuffs?The aforementioned techniques with a bone or spoon can help smooth over rough scuffs on the surface of shell cordovan. You can also get rid of small scratches and scuffs by brushing your shell briskly with a stiff brush (short horse hair or boar\u2019s hair brush) and assist this process with a light layer of cream or conditioner.I have some vintage shell cordovan shoes that I want to ensure keep the same exact color\u2014what should I use?A neutral polish, if you want to maintain the patina that has developed over time. If they are NOS (new old stock) and haven\u2019t been worn, touched, or developed any sort of patina, do your best to color-match cream polishes. The pigment from the cream will mostly stay embedded within the wax itself. So, you won\u2019t have to worry about it dying the shell a different shade. If it\u2019s between colors, select the closest color or hue that you\u2019d want to highlight under the light you will be wearing it (indoors or outdoors).How do I repair old, beaten, weathered shell cordovan?It takes a lot to beat up shell cordovan. Even 50 year old shell cordovan can come back to life with a good amount of quality care. If it hasn\u2019t been ripped or torn, you can start first with a good wipe-down, thorough cleaning, and conditioning.Brush it briskly before wearing. Wear them lightly, then add another layer of protective cream or conditioner, and then let it absorb overnight. Let it slowly come back to health.If I find some really old, beaten up shell shoes\u2026should I buy them? Can they be resurrected? What should I be looking for, on the good or bad side?Look for rips/tears in the shell itself. Those are extremely difficult or impossible to repair. Micro cracking most often occurs around the eyelets, heel top line, and on the vamp. Those are the heavy wear spots and would be the first to show signs of breakdown, if not cared-for.Ensure it\u2019s the correct sizing. You probably won\u2019t be able to resize shell shoes very easily, as shell is not stretchy like calfskin.Look for rotting, mold, super compressed insoles \u2013 all the things you\u2019d normally look for with used shoes or boots. But be super picky with regards to sizing, cuts, and tears.Whether you should buy them is really up to you. A quality pair that fits you can last a lifetime, if cared for properly.How should I store my shell shoes and boots? Any special way? Maybe inside a humidor???You can store your shell shoes and boots using a shoe tree and kept inside cloth bags. Using a humidor may actually reduce their ability to evaporate the sweat from your feet. So, that\u2019s not recommended. You want to keep them in a dry and clean environment.I\u2019ve heard about the pencil trick\u2014putting a pencil across the vamp of new shell shoes and then flexing them (without walking) a number of times to get nice straight rolls started. Any idea if that actually works?For new shell cordovan shoes, you will want to establish a fixed flex-point. This can be both beneficial for the soles, as well as (in tighter-fitting shell shoes), setting the top creases, and fixing the shell from \u201crolling\u201d loosely. In shoes where the volume isn\u2019t a tight-fit, it will be more difficult to fix the flex point, and likewise, fix the rolls to a set point.Is there anything else I should know?Nope, that\u2019s literally everything, as promised by the headline.Andy Vaughn is the brains behindPure Polish, a complete line of 100% natural and biodegradable shoe care products made in small batches in Bend Oregon.

The shoemaking tradition passed over from Dutch colonists certainly seems to have had an impact, the ability to easily adventure out into the wilderness must be a factor, and the whole \u201clots of people in Indonesia ride motorcycles\u201d thing is very real.But whatever the reason, the boot scene in Indonesia\u2014largely centered in Bandung, the country\u2019s fashion capital in terms of schooling, manufacturing, and overall style influence\u2014is very real. With dozens of makers running small workshops and deploying handwelting techniques for a range of styles, North American and European interest in Indonesian products has grown significantly in the past half-decade.That interest has driven innovation, in terms of footwear patterns, leather sourcing and usage, and overall construction and finishing quality. And boot lovers get to reap the rewards. It\u2019s basically impossible to find a handmade product at the price Indonesian makers offer anywhere else, and it\u2019s zero stretch to say that some of those makers create some of the most excellent rugged boots in the world, price be damned. (And let\u2019s not forget aboutWinson, one of the better high-end dress shoe makers you\u2019ll find anywhere).While we can safely predict you\u2019ll begin to see more ready-to-wear options from makers in the near future, the soul of Indonesian bootmaking has been, currently is, and may forever bemade-to-order boots and shoes. Yes you can always just find a photo of their boots and say \u201cmake me these!\u201d But then fun is in working with a maker to select leather, pattern, hardware, outsoles, and everything in between.So how does a boot lover sort through them all and figure out what\u2019s best for them? Well, by reading this very story. Then by spending a ton of time with their work. And finally, by getting in touch, and dreaming big.This story will grow over time. Not every Indonesian bootmaker is present (that would be tough!), but the hope is every meaningful one will be one day. Also, advancements in the Indonesian bootmaking scene happen at an absurdly impressive pace. But for right now, we like to humbly think it\u2019s a fantastic resource to get you started, or if you\u2019re already in deep, to tip you off to a new maker that could be the next big thing.MORE INDONESIAN BOOT COVERAGEGetting to Know Sagara Bootmaker\u2019s Bagus Satrio Through Our Shared Love of MusicHow To Do Made-To-Order Footwear From Indonesia and China the Right WayA Very Important Indonesian Bootmakers Update: The Stitchdown ShoecastOnderhoud Handmade ReviewBriselblack Bootmaker(Formerly Benzein)At this point, Briselblack\u2014which changed its name from Benzein a few years back\u2014is one of Indonesia\u2019s most lauded and trusted bootmakers. The original brand was started in 2018 but its lead man Adi comes from a generational shoemaking family.

All in all, Imperium is a brand that seems to be still finding themselves a bit (hell, they also make double-monk dress shoes alongside some of the beefier lace to toes we\u2019ve seen), but we definitely like the journey they\u2019re on, and the price is right.Price Range:Local leather $200+, imported $300+, horsebutt $360+Construction Styles:Handwelted, stitchdown, Norwegian, veldtschoen, flat welt, BlakeHeel Styles:Block, logger, CubanHow to Contact:Whatsapp or InstagramMTM Options:Split sizing, last adjustments, custom lastsLeather:Local leather plus imported leather by request (Horween, C.F.

A trained footwear designer also obsessed with vintage military clothing (and music of all kinds; check out this fantastic interview with Bagus here to really get to know him), Bagus and Sagara have had infinite influence on the Indonesian boot scene.

      "body": "How Horween Natural Chromexcel AgesJosh BornsteinJuly 12, 2022HorweenChromexcel\u2014or CXL, as they call it in the Chicago tannery\u2014has certainly established itself as one of the deservingly premier leathers for high-quality boots and shoes. The pull-up leather is soft and pliable but highly durable, easy to work with throughout the shoe- or boot-making process, and at its best, looks absolutely stunning when worn hard.NaturalChromexcel is a dye-free version of Horween\u2019s flagship leather\u2026and offers sure-thing aging potential that few other leathers can.So what is this stuff? What goes into making it? And how can you expect your pair of natural Chromexcel leather boots or shoes to wear and patina over time? Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for\u2026What is Chromexcel Leather?Chromexcel is a legendaryHorweenleather that has stood the test of time, made for over a century with a formula that has been largely unchanged since the first sides of CXL came out of Horween\u2019s doors.Interestingly, when Chromexcel first appeared in 1913, it wasn\u2019t meant for shoes or other personal leather goods; instead, its main application was for mechanical purposes, like in motor seals and gaskets in trucks and even tanks (the first World War broke out not long after the leather was first released).Today, it is one of the most ubiquitous and popular shoe leathers out there, and for good reason. CXL is a combination-tanned leather\u2014it\u2019s chrome-tanned, followed by a vegetable (tree bark) re-tan. Chrome tanning provides the leather with a soft suppleness, while veg tanning gives the leather a more rigid temper and a better chance at developing patina.With a combo-tanned leather like CXL, you\u2019re basically getting the best of both worlds. CXL is quite pliable but has a strong \u201cbackbone,\u201d and it can take a shine or be left alone to age ruggedly.Additionally, CXL is hot-stuffed with a proprietary blend of oils, waxes, and grease. This provides the leather with its signature pull-up effect, where the oils and waxes disperse and lighten up when the leather gets pressed or pulled. Hot-stuffing also provides the leather with additional softness and water resistance. After hot-stuffing, most CXL will be hand-coated with aniline dyes and then finished with neatsfoot oil. (For a great look at how CXL gets made from beginning to end, check out Nick Horween\u2019sblog.)In the case of Natural CXL, those dyes don\u2019t get applied. What we\u2019re left with is a sort of beige tan color, the tone and intensity of which can vary from hide to hide. That natural canvas provides a great starting point for all kinds of wonderful patina to happen.How Natural Chromexcel Ages onVibergService BootsFor an excellent example of how this leather ages, let\u2019s start by looking at the Natural CXL pair from thechampionof our inauguralPatina Thunderdome, Steven Lee. Steven participated in a pair ofViberg x Lost & Found Service Boots in Natural CXL.Month ZeroIn the beginning, the leather on Steven\u2019s boots looked fairly uniform. A couple of subtle dark spots here and there where the oils and waxes were concentrated, but nothing crazy.Months Three and FourHere we can see the leather really began to come to life. Creases became pronounced as the leather broke in and began to mold to Steven\u2019s feet\u2014luckily with some fairly tight break. (Chromexcel is infamous for having some wild crease lines.) Scuffs and other spots of heavy wear became darkened and set in. The overall color became more of a light brown.Month SevenWhen we finally arrive at the end of the contest, we can see that this CXL has achieved a surprising degree of depth and beauty. The color could best be described as \u201cburnt sugar.\u201d Not only has the leather taken on a bold patina, Steven has also been able to get it cleaned up quite nicely, providing it with a terrific shine.How Natural Chromexcel Ages on Oak Street Bootmaker Trench BootsLet\u2019s take a look at another Thunderdome pair. TheseOak Street Bootmaker Trench Bootswere worn byPhil Kalas, co-founder ofAshland Leather(who also happens to be a former Horween employee). They\u2019re not too different from where Steven\u2019s pair started.Month ZeroMonth FourAt the time Phil took these check-in photos, he\u2019d just been walking through some slush and snow. CXL takes on a much darker and more matte appearance when it gets soaked, and while the contrast may seem alarming, the leather\u2019s lighter color and luster will return after drying and getting a good brush.Month SevenBy the end, Phil\u2019s boots look incredible. The toe caps alone have a whole universe of patina in them. It looks like Phil wore these hard, but lovingly.How Natural Chromexcel Ages on EasymocsOur third example is a Thunderdome pair that was worn by Chris, who goes by the handle MonsieurLeDude over on Reddit, where he compiledthis excellent and thorough retrospectiveof his experience wearing the eponymousEasymoc.Month ZeroMonth TwoAlready, the aging here isquiteadvanced, especially around the collar (an area of high wear for shoes that are easy to slip into like the Easymoc). Chris said he wore these shoes more often than any other pair before, and it shows.Month SevenFinally, at the conclusion of the Thunderdome, you can really see that these Easymocs were pushed to the limit. While the insoles look pretty rough and these are likely ready for a resole, the CXL uppers have broken in magnificently.In Conclusion\u2026Whether you\u2019re looking for a pair of boots that\u2019ll clean up nicely, take a beating, and/or for a project like thePatina Thunderdome\u2026you could do a lot worse than Natural Chromexcel.Previous ArticleShoes \u2018n\u2019 Boots of the Week: Oak Street Goes Whole Hog, Loads of Loafers at Sons of Henrey, and MoreNext ArticleA Handsewn Life Made in Maine: the Stitchdown Conversation With Mike and Kyle Rancourt of Rancourt & Co.Related PostsEverything You Need To Know About How Leather is TannedZaid HintzmanOctober 9, 202512 Essential Horween Footwear Leathers: How They\u2019re Made, and How They AgeZaid HintzmanJuly 25, 2025How Tariffs Will Affect The Quality Footwear Industry\u2014The First of Probably Too Many PostsBen RobinsonApril 4, 2025Shoecast BONUS Episode Preview: Shop Talk With Brett Viberg & Shuyler Mowe of Nicks BootsBen RobinsonDecember 17, 2024Brett Viberg is Back on the Shoecast, and He\u2019s Bringing LoafersBen RobinsonNovember 19, 2024Viberg\u2019s Latest Collection Probes The Boundaries Between Dress and Casual, and Intros a\u2026Monk Strap?!Zaid HintzmanSeptember 17, 2024",

      "body": "What Each Stitchdown Patina Thunderdome Judge Will be Looking ForBen RobinsonAugust 2, 2021The Stitchdown Patina Thunderdomeis coming up Oct 1, in case you haven\u2019t heard. And the concept underpinning this whole crazy/wonderful venture\u2014wear the hell out of your boots (or shoes!) while still caring about them deeply, and let\u2019s all watch what happens together\u2014may be largely straightforward.But with almost $15,000 in prizes (mostly boots) on the line for dozens of winners, of course it would be helpful to understand what our esteemed judges will be looking for. So here they are.Read the Official Patina Thunderdome RulesJesse Ducommun,Guarded GoodsI\u2019m more than excited for this competition, as it\u2019s going to give many folks the opportunity to see how far some of these leathers can go. Working with leather on an almost daily basis allows me the luxury of experiencing most of the leathers that will be used first-hand\u2014but in their pristine state. There is nothing better than getting an email or message from a customer highlighting how their wallet has aged and the story accompanying it. The journey of the various varieties of leathers that we, as a collective group, will get to see age will provide an invaluable resource to anyone into leather goods or footwear.There are many ways to go about wearing and caring for your footwear. You can beat them up and give them no type of care. You can artificially patina them with sunfading, sanding, dying, or throwing them in the washing machine (please don\u2019t do that!). Or you can give them some well-earned natural patina by balancing the hard wearing of your boots and giving them the occasional care and attention they need.It\u2019s evident when a pair of footwear has been babied, or similarly, when a pair has been utterly thrashed. I will be looking for the perfect balance of both. Aged, darkened, and visibly worn leather that has obviously seen some amount of care (brushing, occasional conditioning) is what I\u2019ll be seeking\u2014and done through simply living your life in your pair, not by artificial means.Wyatt Gilmore,Grant StoneOne of the upsides to better-grade footwear is the ability for them to patina naturally. In my experience, some of the best patina comes from normal wear and routine leather care. In other words, it isn\u2019t necessary to subject the boots to abnormal or extreme conditions to achieve a rich aesthetic. For example, when the leather patinas naturally, the sole, toe spring, vamp creases, and upper wear age in tandem. This is the main reason it\u2019s so difficult for brands to distress new boot to provide a vintage look. It can be done through stone washing, burnishing, and staining techniques, but it rarely has a deep, full-bodied character that a truly heavily worn pair will.While personal opinion, some of the best-looking worn boots have a slight sheen and depth in the leather due to conditioning when needed. Wear them hard, but there is no need to neglect the footwear! Regardless of the brand, a pair of quality welted footwear should last well beyond the life of the Dome\u2014and that\u2019s the idea here.While it may be obvious, some leathers are far more receptive than others, so this should be considered. That is not to say chrome-tanned calf cannot age beautifully, it just may not be as dramatic.One tip: applying a conditioner or cream of your choice on the welt/midsole/sole edge can help richen the leather and won\u2019t take away from the character. Avoid using a darker color as it can limit the depth, giving a pigmented look. When in doubt, use neutral.Neil Berrett,Standard & StrangeI\u2019ll be looking for boots that have been transformed by the wearer. It does not need to be an extreme transformation or the most aggressive patina, but rather one that shows they\u2019ve been well loved, lived in, worn, and been through abundant experiences\u2014likethe face of Ron Perlman. Boots in obvious disrepair will be judged negatively. Wear your boots hard, but take care of them and show them the respect they deserve.I\u2019m also looking for effort in your submissions\u2014approach it as if you\u2019re submitting them to be published. The photos don\u2019t need to be professional quality by any means, but take some time with them. They should be properly exposed, interesting, and your boots should look great.The written story at the end of the competition will be nearly as important as the photos to me. Put some effort into sharing how these boots became a part of your life for seven months, what you did in them, what it all meant to you. Be genuine. Be creative. Make it interesting. Tell a story, make me curious and wanting more. Abandon formal writing structures if necessary, but I need to see effort. You are presenting a report to judges that hold power to give you cool prizes and very possibly internet fame amongst niche footwear enthusiasts (for better or worse).Some morsels of insight into what kind of judge I am: I\u2019m a photographer, a grouch, am annoyed by superlative statements and excessive internet slang, but am easily amused and love a clever gag. I do sales for a living and can smell bullshit from a mile away. Above all, I value genuineness and authenticity over hype and braggadocio.Vic Tsao,Dr. SoleWhen it comes to boot-aging, I\u2019m looking for the natural beauty of fades on the surfaces and creases on the vamp and shaft generated by the daily use.There are many factors affecting the result of aging, such as the leather you choose, how you wear them, how you clean and condition them, and so on. For me, the attractiveness of boot-aging is that there are no two boots on Earth that will age exactly the same way. Every type of leather has its own characteristics, and every wearer develops his/her/their own unique aging result depending on their lifestyle, and how they treat the boots.The reason why I care so much about the selection of leather is that every leather has its own potential and limit. For instance, some leathers look stunning when they are brand new but they might not be as impressive after being worn; some leathers might look plain at the beginning but have endless potential to develop beautiful results.To sum up, it\u2019s essential to learn what kind of leather your boots are, always do research, picture the potential result in your mind, and wear them with pride.Ben Robinson, StitchdownOur esteemed judges are much smarter and better-looking than me, so it\u2019s no surprise that they pretty much covered it with their statements above.Neil mentioned how important the short written story at the end of the Thunderdome will be to him; I 1000% agree, but the boots need to tell their own as well. So wear them hard\u2014because they can take it and will look better for it\u2014while still always treating them right. Maybe most importantly, my sincere hope is that everyone will use these seven months as a constantly regenerating excuse to GO DO THINGS. So, get out and have some fun.
