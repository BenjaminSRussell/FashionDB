A jacket has two functions: Keep you warm, of course, and define the rest of your outfit.14 October,2025ByMike HensonThis post may contain affiliate links, read about oureditorial promiseRevised & Updated Fall 2025When I was in college, I got a job working at the Cole Haan boutique in the King of Prussia Mall near Philly. Cole Haan's shoe styles were still somewhat conservative, but their men's jackets had a rebellious flare that quickly seduced me. After a year, I'd racked up $2000 worth of jackets (though I won't say how much I actually paid with my employee discount). It's been well over a decade, and I still have all of those jackets…and several more.When you throw your jacket on in the morning, you setthe tone for your day. Like choosing between loafers or workboots, choosing between different types of jackets is a matter of formandfunction. What's the temperature? Could it rain or snow? Am I feeling formal, casual, business, or athletic today? Your jacket choice is the result of these decisions.But sometimes, you might not know where to start. We've compiled a list of the most common men's jacket styles. Keep the list going in the comments if we didn't include your favorite or if you have experience with any of our picks.Table of ContentsField JacketBarn JacketMotorcycle Field JacketBomber JacketChore CoatDenim JacketTrucker JacketShirt JacketHarrington JacketLeather JacketBiker JacketFleece JacketPea CoatShearling JacketMac JacketPuffer JacketVestCoach JacketWaxed Canvas JacketBlazerRain CoatPackable JacketParkaSuede JacketTechnical JacketFishtail ParkaQuilted JacketVarsity JacketOvercoatField JacketSimilar:Propper/Fall Getup Week: That Blur Between the End of Summer and Fall WeatherThefield jacketis one of the few sartorial pieces that perfectly mates form with function, meaning 1) It will never go out of style, and 2) You'll always have a spare pocket for your keys. The field jacket is easily recognizable as it typically has 3-4 exterior pockets and a generous fit (so you can layer up underneath). The originalM-65 field jacketwas developed in tandem with NYCO, a cotton/nylon blend that offered improved water and wind resistance over previous iterations.Today, outerwear companies have gotten creative with their fabrics, offering field jackets in cotton canvas,waxed canvas, and cotton blends.As the design evolved, it branched into three main styles: themilitary field jacket(based on the M-65), thebarn-style field coat(country and workwear-inspired), and themotorcycle field jacket(belted and waxed for weather and speed). Each traces its roots to the same purpose-built heritage, adapted for a different environment.Barn Jacket or FieldCoatA barn jacket over ashawl collar cardigan sweaterThe barn jacket comes from a different field, literally. It was designed for work around farms and barns, built from heavy cotton canvas or waxed cotton with a boxier cut and a soft corduroy collar. Where the field jacket’s structure comes from military design, the barn jacket’s comfort comes from rural practicality. It often includes flannel or quilted lining for warmth, patch pockets placed lower on the body, and a more relaxed fit overall.There’s clear overlap between the two: both are utilitarian, built for layering, and look better with age. The field jacket leans precise and tactical, the barn jacket leans easy and broken-in. One feels ready for a mission, the other for a long walk through wet leaves, but both embodytimeless, functional outerwear that never feels out of place.Live Action Getup: The Everyday Outfit You Can Count OnBrands like Barbour,L.L.Bean, and Orvis popularized the modern versions. TheBarbour BedaleandBeaufortin particular represent the classic countryside field coat: water-resistant, durable, and refined enough for the city. While the field jacket feels military and structured, the barn jacket feels relaxed and ready for anything.Read more about field jackets:The 10 Best Field JacketsHow to wear a field jacket:Live Action Getup: Colder Weather Casual LayersFall Getup Week: Light Fall LayersLive Action Getup: Upgrading Your Lazy CasualLive Action Getup: Autumn Layers in the CityMotorcycle Field JacketLive Action Getup: Spring TransitionThe Belstaff Jacket (originally spelledBellstaffand often called the “moto”) was introduced in 1924 in Staffordshire, England. The goal was straightforward: make durable, weatherproof gear for motorcyclists. They used Egyptian cotton treated with wax, creating one of the first breathable yet water-resistant fabrics in commercial outerwear.Unlike the military field jacket or the rural barn coat, the motorcycle field jacket was engineered for movement and protection. It’s longer than a typical leather moto, often belted at the waist to stay secure while riding, and reinforced at key seams. The four symmetrical front pockets and high, buckle-fastening collar weren’t decorative: They served practical needs for tools, maps, and shielding from wind.A motorcycle field jacketThe design became standard gear for British riders in the mid-20th century and later caught on as rugged everyday wear. TheBelstaff Trialmasterand Barbour International remain the two definitive examples, both using waxed cotton and a structured cut that still feels modern.Today’s versions carry the same purpose-built DNA, bridging function and style in a way few jackets manage. A waxed moto field jacket offers weather protection, shape, and attitude without the bulk or heat of leather.How to wear a moto jacket:This Live Action Getup Proves an Important Fashion ConceptBomber JacketYou probably know that thebomber jacket was originally created for pilots, but you may not know that the streamlinedsilhouetteyou see today was at the outset, crafted from seal leather and lined with fur. Over the decades, the bomber has seen several iterations, loosening its insulation requirements as airplane cockpits have become warmer.Today thebomber jacket is the throw-it-on-for-anything jacketin terms of style: Going to the store in your sweats for milk? Throw on your bomber. Going out for drinks with the fellas? Bomber. And with different colors, cuts, and levels of warmth available, you can have a different bomber for each season. Not sure where to start? Try something like thislightweight bomberfrom Levi's. The polyester will resist the wind and rain, and the trim cut will keep you looking svelte.Similar jacket:Levi's/ Photo from:Minimalist Style: Dress Better With Less Effort + 5 Complete Getups For InspirationLearn more about bomber jackets:The Bomber Jacket: How to Wear ItBomber jacket outfits:Live Action Getup: Anything But NeutralThe Amazon Outfit: Weekend Work SessionYou Won’t Believe This Road Trip Is In America + 4 Getups2 Different Outfit Approaches to a First DateAre Jackets and Coats Different Things?Technically yes, in real use the line is blurry. By definition, a coat is an outer garment for the upper body, a jacket is the shorter cousin, everyday language stretches both.Some jackets go past the hips, some coats stop short. The M65 field jacket runs to the thigh, brands and the public call it a jacket, the original military spec even labeled it a coat. Pea coats sit at the hip, car coats land mid-thigh, topcoats come lighter than overcoats, so length and weight refuse to play hall monitor.A coat is usually your outermost, weatherproof, insulating layer (overcoats, topcoats, trench coats). A jacket might be short, light, tailored, rugged, or warm depending on context (field jackets, sport coats, leather jackets, bombers). Parkas are often treated as jackets, some sources list them as coats too.Why the overlap, and why the names that ignore logic. History and function set the families, culture cements the labels. Sport coats started as country-sport gear, now a tailored jacket worn without matching trousers. Trench coats take their name from construction and military origin, warmth varies.Bottom line, labels follow style families and history, not strict measurements, so expect exceptions.Denim JacketDenim Trucker Jacket:Levi's/AmazonPlenty of companies make a denim jacket, but no on does it quite like Levi's. The denim, or jean jacket dates back to the late 1800s. It was originally created for farmers and gold prospectors with seams that could be easily let out and moved if the wearer needed a looser fit. When you picture a denim jacket, you probably see this one fromLevi's, which is their classicTrucker Jacket.The metal buttons and v-shaped seams make it unmistakable. Suitable for a spring day with a light breeze, a summer evening, or a fall evening with layers, the denim jacket has a rugged casualness that looks laid back but intentional.We feature it regularly in our outfit inspiration due to its versatility amongsmart casual.It's important to note that while the denim trucker jacket is the most ubiquitous, there are other types of jackets that can be made of denim, most commonly a chore coat:Tellason made in USA denim chore coatRead more about denim jackets:What’s The Difference Between A Trucker Jacket And A Denim Jacket?How to wear:Live Action Getup: The Black Denim JacketMedium wash denim jacketAll from Amazon: 3 Fall Outfits I Styled for the Amazon Style StoreLight denim jacketGray denim jacketTrucker JacketJacket:Flint & Tinder Waxed Trucker JacketThetrucker jacket has an intriguing history, from protecting cowboys from storms to keepingRobert Redford looking like a stud.

The fabric comes from New Jersey, and the jacket is crafted in Los Angeles with a soft flannel lining to keep you warm.Buck Mason twill trucker jacket /similarFlint and Tinder (which started as an American-made underwear company) even takes the extra time to wax the fabric on both sides for extra resilience.

There was a myriad of jobs to do, and the weather was just starting to turn chilly. One crisp Saturday morning I threw on my chore coat with a t-shirt and a sweatshirt underneath and set aside two hours to pressure wash the front of the house. But you know how it goes when you get pressure washin'. Next thing I know I'm doing the back porch, and then I started eyeing up the deck. Five hours and two meals later, I'd ditched the sweatshirt, but I was still rockin' the chore coat over my t-shirt.SimilarIt's for a walk in the woods or a casualweekend away.

Freshly shined penny loafers with a pair of Nantucket reds and a bow tie, and I feel right at home (maybe a copy of Gatsby in my back pocket in case I get bored). On a sunny day, you'll see me rockin' my basket-weavenavy blazer, but if there's a chill in the air, I get out the Harrington.Like a Mini Cooper with a hemi, theHarringtonis a total sleeper in terms of versatility. Also known as a blouson jacket, wear a Harrington with chinos and a button down; wear it with jeans and yourbrown leather sneakers. Hell, throw it onwith a pair of shortson a cool summer evening.

This one from Uniqlo was $30 and looks swell.Jacket: Uniqlo (OoS)See the long history of the Harrington:The Harrington Jacket – How to Wear It, History, & Affordable PicksHarrington jacket outfits:The Getup: Spring, Where You At?Get Out of the House with Great Summer Style Made SimpleLeather JacketIt was fifty-five degrees in my part of Pennsylvania today, and my wife and I had some errands to run (My mom watched the kids, so we called it a date). I threw on jeans, suede chukkas, a sweatshirt, and my leather jacket, and I felt smooth. The leather jacket is the ultimate feather in the cap ofsmart casual: It's intentional without being presumptuous.Leather jackets can come in lots of different styles, from the classic racer style to bombers, blazers, and everything in between. The most famous style is probably the double rider: The classic leather jacket with big collars and asymmetrical zipper, shown in its own section below.The first commercially available leather jacket was released in the early 1900s for motorcyclists; if you fell, the leather would take the brunt of the road rash instead of your own skin (it took a while to figure out that helmets were a good idea too).This Classic Nike High Top is the Sneaker We’re Wearing This FallMarlon Brando and James Dean wore leather jackets inThe Wild OneandRebel Without a Causerespectively, and suddenly it was the sartorial staple of the 1950s. Perfect for fall days or days like today when spring is doing its best to make an entrance.

Biker jackets feature a trim cut (so they're not great for layering), a short torso (so you can easily lean over the side of your bike without having a button dig into your pelvis), and ample hardware for ruggedness. While the double rider biker jacket lends itself to a more casual look, it actually complements ashirt and tie quite well. Pairing your work wear with a little bit of renegade is always a cool move.Fleece JacketJacket shown:Amazon EssentialsWhen I hear polyester, my mind goes toSaturday Night Fever, but the polyester of today is not the polyester of the 1970s when your dad wore platform shoes and shirts with collars points down to his armpits. Today's polyester fleece is lightweight, soft, and breathable, allowing you to stay warm and (relatively) dry without breaking a sweat.It won't shrink when you dry it, and because it's a synthetic fabric, it keeps its shape. The best part? You don't need to drop $100 to get a more-than decent fleece jacket. This fleece from Amazon comes in 26 styles and hits a price point that won't make you cringe.Pea CoatLive Action Getup: Classic in Any EraThe pea coat is one of the few coats that has seen very little change since its inception. Why? Because it's hard to update perfect. Like quite a few men's coats, the pea coat finds its roots in the military,originally crafted in the 1700s for Dutch sailorsfrom rough, thick wool. The term “pea” is thought to come from the Dutch word “pij” or “pije” (depending on the source), which described the wool.The British navy popularized the style, and we're still wearing them today. The modern pea coat is slightly more fitted than the original, but the oversized collar, hem just below the waist, and double-breasted button closure remain. And because a classic never dies, plenty of companies have their own take on thepea coat, meaning you can choose the one that fits your personal taste and your budget.Get a good one:These Are The 23 Best Men's Pea Coats, Car Coats, Walker Coats, and OvercoatsHow to wear a pea coat:Live Action Getup: Remixing 4 Other Outfits to Create a New OneSpectre Style: Casual Style Inspired by Daniel Craig’s James BondA Classic Cold Weather Capsule Wardrobe With A Modern Edge + 10 Getups!Starting Time: Building an Outfit Around a Seiko Dive WatchFantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them: Menswear at the MoviesThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou: Menswear at the MoviesStarting Time: Building an Outfit Around a Timex WaterburyShearling JacketLevi's shearling trucker jacketThe shearling jacket hits that sweet spot when it's too cool for a trucker but too warm for a pea coat. If you go for genuine shearling, which comes from sheep, you'll spend a few hundred at least (and that's if you catch a deal).Levi'sLuckily faux-fur shearling (which is essentially hi-pile, textured fleece and labeled as “sherpa”) retains warmth nearly as well as the real thing. It's also easier to maintain (because you can wash it), and it won't mat down as easily as genuine shearling. A sherpa trucker like this one is soft and easy to wear like a heavy sweatshirt.Mac JacketBrock McGoffThe Mackintosh, or Mac…or rain coat actually dates back to the 1800s. Charles Mackintosh, a chemist, devised a way to insert a layer of liquid rubber between an interior and exterior layer of fabric. And the Mac was born. Traditionally a Mac was cut for wear over a suit, but the modern Mac is slightly tailored. You can certainly layer it over a suit or a thicksweater, but you don't have to.Trench CoatHow to Wear a Trench Coat Without Looking Like a 1930s DetectiveTrench coats became iconic after service by British officers in World War I, but their story starts almost a century earlier, as a response to the popularity of the Mackintosh coat. Traditionally trench coats are below the knee, double breasted and feature wide lapels, and a waist belt, though you can find coats labeled as trench coats that feature other styles.Puffer Jacket10 Best Winter Jackets That Prioritize Warmth But Are Still StylishThe puffer jacket is your quintessential winter jacket. It's lightweight, it's warm, and it has just enough moisture resistance to get you through a snow shower.There's nothing wrong with an extra puffy puffer jacket, but anymore, insulation technology has allowed for more svelte options likethis onefrom L.L. Bean with down that's been treated to allow it to stay dry even when wet.VestAlso known as a gilet, the vest is one type of outerwear men sleep on the most. It's the perfect layer for those frustrating-to-dress-for days where a thicker coat would be too hot after a certain point. The torso-covering vest keeps heat in while not insulating the arms, a way of regulating body temperature while also looking damn cool.Check outPrimer's guide to this turtleneck and vest combowhich will have you looking as sharp as style contributor Daniel Baraka and not an old guy on the ski lift.Coach JacketThe history of the coach's jacket is in the name. In the 90s, this lightweight windbreaker-style jacket (complete with snap button closure) was worn by NFL coaches all over the country (with a big ol' team logo on the back). It moves easily; it resists moisture in case it starts to drizzle, and snap buttons mean it goes on and off easily so the coach can stay comfortable without missing a play.Waxed Canvas JacketShown:Rogue Territory Ridgeline Supply Jacket featured inNo Time to DieThismay be the best damn looking jacket on the entire list, and I'm not just saying that because Daniel Craig wears it inNo Time to Die.Ok…that might have something to do with it. Thewaxed canvas jacketis the one you throw on in fall or winter over top of a sweater, or for the spring camping weekend when it's going to be cool at night, but you'll be sitting by the fire.The Black Waxed Canvas JacketOver time, the canvas will crease, darken, absorb dirt and oil from your hands, and it'll keep looking good. In a few years, throw a fresh coat ofOtter Waxon it, and you're back to factory specs for moisture resistance.Starting Time: Building an Outfit Around a Fossil Hybrid SmartwatchRead more about waxed canvas jackets:The 9 Best Waxed Canvas Jackets: History, Style, and Affordable PicksHow to wear a waxed canvas jacket:Live Action Getup: Spring Transition + 7 Waxed Canvas Jacket OptionsLive Action Getup: Rugged Fall CasualStarting Time: Building an Outfit Around a Fossil Hybrid SmartwatchBlazerBlazer, No Tie: 5 Specific Tips for Hitting the Dressy Sweet Spot in a Casual AgeAs a card-carrying prep,the navy blazeris my go-to jacket for every season and almost any occasion. It is the essence of versatility in that it looks good on any man regardless of body type, and shy of black-tie-only, it's appropriate for most occasions. A night out with your partner?

This is where the traditional rain coat comes into play.If you're like me, you're thinking that all that waterproofing doesn't allow for a lot of air movement. But this jacket has a trick up it's sleeve: zippered vents with lightweight mesh to keep moisture out while allowing for air flow.AnorakThe word anorak comes from the native Greenalndic languageannoraaq. Similar to a parka (itself having native Russian etymology), an anorak is a hooded, pullover hip-length jacket usually made of nylon to provide wind and water protection. They've regained fashion popularity in the last two decades or so and often come in bright solid colors or a mix of bright colors. Due to their pull-over style, nylon construction, and zipper pouch, anoraks arecasual wearjackets, often chosen for weather utility.Packable JacketShown:Amazon/ Upgrade:Ralph LaurenIn the back of my SUV, I have a fleece blanket, amultitool, and a packable jacket. Why? Because dammit you just never know. And let's be honest: the packable jacket is just cool. Here's a piece of clothing that will keep you warmandneatly pack into itself for easy storage – there's something profound in its simplicity. This one fromAmazonis made from nylon (which will cut the wind and resist moisture) with polyester filling for added insulation. And at $45 with 11 color options, it's a no-brainer.ParkaShown:PatagoniaWhen the elements are kicking your ass, you reach for the parka. Originally made from seal skin by the Caribou Inuits, the parka is a garment designed for true cold weather activity and is one of the best types of jackets to stay warm in the winter. The body is cut below the waist, the interior is insulated (usually with down or a down alternative), and pockets have storm flaps and buttons (or velcro). This one from Patagonia is made with recycled 600-fill down, stretch canvas, and a hood that will cover your head and neck. Winter's got nothin' on you.Suede JacketThis is the Leather Jacket Style Every Guy Can Pull OffThe best part about a suede jacket is that every guy canmake it work. The suede racer compliments any body shape and looks as good at the bar as it does at the office. Suede gives you the durability of leather, but it breathes better and has a soft hand.Technical JacketThe North FaceThe first jacket I ever bought from The North Face was anApex. I was 22, fresh out of school, and the Apex was my graduation gift to myself. That was 13 years ago, and it's still hanging in my closet. A tech jacket (named for the tech fabric from which it's made) is the Swiss Army knife of jackets: it's warm, it cuts the wind, and it's waterproof (the Apex uses a proprietary fabric with a polyurethane coating, which allows the fabric to breathe while keeping moisture out).If there's rain in the forecast, and you're going for a hike or traversing the city, the tech jacket won't let you down.Fishtail ParkaThe Essentials: Gray Denim – 6 Complete Outfits That Prove It Will Change Your WardrobeThe name says it all: the fishtail parka is cut long in the body with a short vent at the bottom of the back, which kind of looks like a…well…you get it.This onefrom Alpha Industries is made from a cotton/poly blend for high breathability while still keeping you dry. The front placket adds a layer of moisture resistance while the drawstrings let you decide how tapered you want the fit.Quilted JacketSimilar:Ralph LaurenIn the springtime, my default weekend outfit is jeans and asolid t-shirt. A simple way to enhance this look is by adding a little texture, and this is what a quilted jacket does best. The quilted jacket has a way of looking fancy yet casual; call it, “laid-back-equestrian.”The quilted jacket is ideal for layering, so throw it over a sweatshirt to cut the wind and lock in a little extra body heat. This one from Ralph Lauren is handsomely classic.How to wear it:There’s No Shame in Being a Jeans & T-Shirt Guy: Here’s How to Do It IntentionallyVarsity JacketPhoto by Trav WhiteUnfortunately they didn't give out varsity jackets if you were the lead in the musical (not that I'm bitter), but I prefer the kind without letters on them anyway. The varsity jacket traditionally has a wool body with leather sleeves, an American cut (which is to say a bit boxy), and a team's logo on it. These days the varsity jacket has a slightly trimmer cut, and most are made from blends of fleece or cotton. But if you want the real thing, check outthis onefrom Champion.OvercoatI have a problem with overcoats because they look so damn good over a suit or a navy blazer. So I have four of them. The overcoat is cut long in the body with a little extra room in the chest and sleeves to go over your suit for work.The Only 4 Ways to Tie a Scarf You’ll Ever NeedPerhaps more than any other coat on the list, overcoats come in at every price point you can imagine from low-cost options to exorbitantly expensive that costs more than my first car. Camel, navy, or black are the most traditional choices, but don't be afraid togo off the beaten pathwith a pattern.Two Winter Outfits That Will Get You Through 90% of the Rest of the SeasonRead more:These Are The 23 Best Men's Pea Coats, Car Coats, Walker Coats, and OvercoatsHow to wear an overcoat:Live Action Getup: Dressed Up CasualLive Action Getup: Dressed Down Winter ItemsThe Getup: All from Sale Fall MinimalistLive Action Getup: Winter in the CityFinally, Guys Under 6′ Have A Way To Look Great This WinterLive Action Getup Joshua Tree
